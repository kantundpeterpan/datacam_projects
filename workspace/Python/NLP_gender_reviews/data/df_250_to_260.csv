Bio majors have no way around taking him, he's the only bio 13 professor."", ""He's is an EXTREMELY harsh grader!!!!! He is very picky about everything and grades as if you should know how to write lab reports perfectly. In class he is very helpful but otherwise he isn't of much help. I wouldn't recommend him!"", 'Professor seagull had us take 3 tests and a final, and my lab was with his assistant and we had 3 lab reports, and lab quizzes. He pretty much takes the questions out of the slides for the test, so memorization is key. Definitely easier to get an A here than say bio 11. Lectures are good, never really got bored. Study and you should be fine.', ""Not one of the better professors I've had, but is still decent. Pretty strict, and doesn't really seem to have any interest in the students. Emphasizes rote memorization, which kinda sucks. I always phased out halfway through his lectures. He can be pretty helpful outside the classroom, though. Just takes a while to get used to."", 'Just no. Just no. He likes to contradict himself and say ""I taught this in detail"" and expect you to know absolutely every single aspect of effing plants for the tests even if he didn\'t teach it. Or he teaches one thing in class and you put it on the test and he marks it wrong. Tests are all essay. So have fun.', ""Dr Seagull was the best teacher I have had at Hofstra.  I got an A in the class but really had to work for it.  I had a lot of interest in the material that was taught in Bio 13.
