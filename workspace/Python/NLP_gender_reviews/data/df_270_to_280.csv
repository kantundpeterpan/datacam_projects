I learned a lot, but her tests are very hard. Write down everything she says. Read the book, take thorough notes, and you can make a B for sure.', 'This is a good teacher. If you sit on the front row, it will help you not fall asleep.(she does ramble sometimes) Read the chapters, and take good notes. Pay attention closely to her and you will be able to pull the important information out of her lectures! Tests are easy if you study. Take her!', 'Excellent professor.  She teaches objectively without sneaking in her political opinions on you.  VERY easy quizzes given frequently.  You have to study for her tests...they are about 50% lecture and 50% textbook.  You have to go to class and take thorough notes if you want an A/B.', ""The class is easy if you take detailed notes and read the summary Q&A's at the end of each chapter. You will not do will if you don't get the book!!!"", 'Dr. Richardson is amazing!!! Ive taken her for 3 classes and loved them all! She is passionate and an extremely smart woman who truly cares about what you have to say and whether or not you have learned the material. Definately take her youll love her!', ""Read the Chapters and Definitions in the Chapters you would be fine. She have an attitude sometimes but she's alright."", 'Take her if possible! Dr. Richardson issues tests that are properly aligned to her lecture material. If you come to class, take notes well, and read the assigned chapters, you should make an excellent grade. I would recommend her to anyone. She is a very fair teacher.', ""Good teacher. If you've grown up watching the news you and a basic understanding of the US Gov then you should make an easy A."", 'She is wonderful', ""Dr. Richardson teaches it to where you all ready needed to be really knowledgeable in Political Science. Her lectures are all over and usually not relevant. And the test questions are confusing and from the book which she doesn't even use.  I would definitely avoid this teacher if I could do it again."", 'Dr. Richardson is great! she is so interested in what she teaches, even if she can be a bit boring at times. she gives a study guide for her tests. If you study just a little bit, you will have no problem getting a A+ in her class.', ""Crazy crazy lady. I didn't study and got a B, but should have gotten an A. The material isn't hard, but the tests confused me."", ""She jumps all over the place in lecture. I never knew what to write down or where she was going with things. You might want to read the book if you can't take good notes in her class. Her tests were pretty easy though, a lot of common sense questions. If you can manage sitting through a boring class take her because it's fairly easy."", ""Dr. R is a little crazy but if you like politics she's a brilliant kind of crazy! I really enjoyed her! You have to read the book, but once again if you like politics at all it is interesting. Plus the book is very updated so you'll be reading about stuff you are familiar with. Obama is in the book for my fall 08 class! Tests are easy if you study!"", 'AVOID IF AT ALL POSSIBLE!!!! She is soooo boring and makes you sit in some kind of seating chart like we are back in first grade!! She jumps from one subject to the next!!! She is a CRAZY one!!!', ""HATED THIS CLASS!!!!  the woman is insane, jumps from one thing to the next and it's really hard to take notes or stay awake, it's NOT a hard class if you want a B but if you want an A prepare to read you textbook everday, hardly anything she says is on her test, I don't recommend her to my worst enemy"", ""Her class was so incredibly boring! Do not take for an 8:00! Impossible to stay awake. Hard to take notes with the way she teaches. A B is easy to make. Test aren't too bad but you need to read the book. Don't try to ask for an 89.1 to be an A unless you like a door being shut in your face.""]",3.5,"['awful', 'average', 'average', 'awesome', 'average', 'awesome', 'awesome', 'awesome', 'average', 'awesome', 'awesome', 'awesome', 'awful', 'awesome', 'average', 'average', 'awful', 'awful', 'awful', 'awful']","['2.0', '3.5', '3.0', '4.0', '3.0', '4.5', '4.5', '4.5', '3.0', '4.5', '4.0', '5.0', '2.0', '4.5', '3.0', '3.0', '2.5', '1.0', '1.5', '2.0']"
