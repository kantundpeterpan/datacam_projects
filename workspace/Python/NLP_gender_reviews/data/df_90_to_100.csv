I told him I have horrible test anxiety and tests make up most of the grades. He gave extra credit but it didn't help much. He also didn't seem to care that my grandpa (a psychologist himself) was hospitalized which impacted my work. "", ""Riley is one of the best professors at American University and by far the best lecturer I have ever seen. He knowledge is endless, and his slides/explanations are flawless. All the reviews on this are likely Freshman who didn't study the normal amount for a technical stem course. Take Neuro-psychopharmacology and it will change your life."", 'Overall my favorite professor at AU. His classes are tough but its because he genuinely wants you to know the material. He cares about his students and wants them to do the best they possibly can but wont give out easy As. Hes funny, quirky and an extremely intelligent lecturer with years of experience and storys to go along with it.', 'The self-proclaimed ""crazy old man"", Prof Riley, or Tony, is a quirky, foulmouthed guy but is clearly very smart about psych. Make sure you take good notes during lecture and work with classmates to construct a study guide for the tests. You basically have to re-answer what was said in the lecture so as long as you prepare for that you\'ll do fine.', 'PSYC 240 is a hard topic and course. Riley is engaging and enthusiastic about the topic. He is a tough-tough grader. Exams are worth 60% of the course. Study with a buddy. Do not miss deadlines (not accommodating). Do quizzes. Be prepared to ""fail.""', 'Has extremely high standards of students and begins the semester showing off awful reviews like prizes. I really dont recommend him for non-psyc majors. You can attend class, review sessions, and study for HOURS and still not manage to get a decent grade. Has to give tons of extra credit to compensate for it.', ""Riley is a really good and engaging lecturer, but PSYCH 115 is a difficult class. Your grade is entirely based on four difficult exams. The class is fun and I feel like I learned a lot, but I was hoping for a higher grade. You have to do the readings to succeed on the tests, but they're interesting and narrative based."", ""There are four test total in this class. You have to read one book for each exam. He is really funny in class. I wouldn't recommend for a gen ed class."", ""You need to go to the lectures to take notes bc the powerpoints don't make sense without his lecture. Adds a ton of useless info to powerpoints and makes you stress a lot more about exams than you should. 4 exams all open ended short answer. Doesn't give study guides. Gives lots of extra credit. Knows his stuff and helps during office hours."", ""Riley is an animated lecturer, who's obviously very knowledgable. The problem is he has extremely high expectations for a level 100 gen ed. If you are not a psych major, don't torment yourself with this course."", 'Very knowledgeable and passionate about lectures, but gives 4 tests that are all open ended that ask both broad questions and specifics. if you want to do well on the tests you must devote a significant amount of time to studying. however, to make up for the tests he offers a ton of extra credit that can boost you a full letter grade.', 'One of the best professors in AU. Teaches with a lot of passion and is very engaging. I learned a lot in his class.', ""Professor Riley is very interesting and a hilarious professor. However, his class is difficult and requires a lot of attention and note taking. If you like psychology and are willing to put in the time, you'll do well. May not be the best choice for an easy gen ed"", 'What is the point of a class if you are having a mental breakdown every time you have an exam? 10 pages of multi paragraph short answer question for each exam. I never hated college until I took his class.', ""Honestly, for a Gen Ed he was insane. I didn't get much out of the class at all, what I studied for wasn't even on his exams. The entire class is just four exams. You better be a good test taker in order to pass. He is very off topic, isn't super helpful, and if you don't have his books he asks you to read, good luck."", ""just don't do it. It unreasonable difficult and the workload is insane. six books for 14 weeks of school??"", ""Drop this class RIGHT NOW if you aren't a psychology major. I'm a CAS student with a job + own business on the side of school. Unless you have the passion/countless hours to read, study, and MEMORIZE the LOADS of useless (but interesting) information he piles on you, you will FAIL. NO multiple choice on exams and tests on like 9 books/semester."", ""I feel like if you don't like Riley, its probably because psychology isn't interesting to you. Aside from a huge amount of reading, theres relatively little work and its clear what is expected on the tests. Hes generally pretty laid back and he has a weird sense of humor but overall pretty good."", ""The lectures are terribly boring and hard to understand. I don't know how he can make a class that could have been so interesting this awful. Honestly, take bio of something."", ""The absolute Worst! Taking this for FA5? DON'T!
