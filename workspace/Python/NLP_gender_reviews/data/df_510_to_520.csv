As a visual learner, this class was a bit hard as it was 100% auditory. He had us read two books and then gave us tests on them. There were also two bigger tests. Luckily he gives a pretty good bell curve so I got an A. He's not a bad teacher, just not my style."", ""He is very passionate about history therefore he's does go off topic, you might start to question what is important to write down and what's not. However, he is really nice and always willing to help. An interesting aspect of this class is the field trip to Mount Vernon. Besides attending, you are also required to write a paper."", ""Really nice guy who covers a lot of content. He puts an online on the overhead then talks for the entire class so for exams it's difficult to determine what was important. I suggest taking notes in class and from the textbook. You also need to read the two assigned books for the quizzes; they're easy if you read."", ""He's a really nice guy. The lectures last all class. He covers a lot of content, so you have to take good notes. If you study before tests, you should be fine. Also, there will be book quizzes, so make sure you read the books."", ""Professor McCord is incredibly knowledgeable about American history. For someone who is a history major, I really enjoyed his class. It could be really boring for those who aren't interested in history. If you don't read the books you will fail the quizzes. The tests are tough if you do not study at all, and attendance is mandatory for doing well. "", 'History exposed by a real expert,  in a nice low tech  fascinating story telling mode. Always with interesting sidelights and factoids about the events, places and people; yet tied into the main theme of the development of our nation. History text is good, but no need to buy the latest edition; get the previous one off eBay for much less cost.

Don't bother buying the main textbook only buy the two chapter books"", ""Each class consisted of an hour and half lecture based off of an outline you have to copy down verbatim off of a projector. Then there was four novels we had to read, each one accompanied by a quiz with ambiguous questions. So even if you read the book you won't get an A as the answers are debatable. He's knowledgeable, and has passion."", ""AVOID HIM LIKE THE PLAGUE!!!! I got an A in 122 and I also took his Virginia History class later (B+) because 122 wasn't awful but he was the one professor that stressed me out and it was usually for no reasons his books are lengthy and dry. He goes on rants that tend to have to do with about one comment within the material. Please spare yourself!!"", ""This dude is the coolest teacher around, so chill. Class is mandatory for sure though, you absolutely need to go. Gives you two biographies to read, each with a quiz on them which are pretty easy. Tests aren't too bad either. Good class, learned a lot. Dude is awesome, hella funny."", ""He is awesome. Attendance is part of ur grade. He'll tell u whats gonna be on ur exam. Has personal outlines that he puts up on overhead 4 the whole class period. Doesn't use blackboard. Explained events clearly. Reminded us when exams were 1 week before the exam. Very chill. I like him. Recommend him."", ""Dr. McCord is one of the best history profs I've had at Mason. He really knows his stuff, and is extremely helpful. As long as you show up to class & take notes, you'll do fine. He does 4  quizzes on the assigned books, a midterm, & a final."", ""Class is the same everyday. Attendance-so go!  He puts an outline on the board of the chapter and talks about it. Copy down the outline AND what he says too.  Read the 2 books and you'll do fine on the quizzes. Study for the midterm and other exam. Take home essay final! If you go to his office hours he helps. He is sweet, but boring sometimes!"", ""Great Professor. Uses an outline and does a great lecture filling in all the details. Makes little history jokes every once in awhile which is fun. His tests are a little difficult, but as long as you take good notes & study well you should do fine. Do not by the actual text book, you'll never use it. Takes attendance EVERY class! Don't miss!"", ""Good professor all around. Very knowledgable and helpful.
