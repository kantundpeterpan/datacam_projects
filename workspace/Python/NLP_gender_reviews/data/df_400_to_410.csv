Assignments and tests are always fair and he grades fairly as well."", 'An engaging speaker.', 'Lots of texts to read for the class, but worth it. Inspirational and makes you think.', ""He can't teach. His lectures are so dull that just sitting in the class could literally put you to sleep. His slides are only images and excerpts. You will have to rely on the readings because note taking is almost impossible."", ""I don't really enjoy mythology very much but Dr.O'Brien is a really good prof. He loves what he teaches and wants his students to succeed. I did the bare minimum in that class and got a C"", 'loved mythology even more', 'awesome prof', ""Dr.O'Brien strains your brain when he speaks and his lectures are extremely boring."", ""Easily, my favourite prof at Dalhousie. If you take any of his classes you will not only: enjoy and feel emotionally/mentally stimulated in all of his lectures but gush over how amazing this man is. O'Brien uses speech in such insightful ways. His wife is one lucky woman. My love for him is endless and internal."", 'Brilliant. Very passionate about the subject matter, which is reflected in his lectures. Makes a strong effort to get to know the students in his class on a first name basis. Makes understanding complicated stories very simple by going over everything in thorough detail. Gives fair time for all assignments. Favorite prof at Dalhousie. Spectacular', 'Absolutely brilliant.', 'I really enjoyed his class. He obviously loved the material and it really showed in his lectures. Sometimes lectures were hard to follow because the only visual aids we had were a slideshow of images. His tests are very image/date/term based, so focus on that. They are geared towards giving you the opportunity to show everything you know!', ""he's a total greek-speaking dreamboat"", 'i got good notes from his lectures, but when i went to see him he was a lot less personable.. decent class but got pretty confusing about what they really wanted from the assignments', 'Too much to say in such a limited space.', ""I loved Dr. O'Brien! He often got off-topic but he was very passionate about his stuff. Incredibly fair, his tests always had options for questions, and if you attended the classes you knew the stuff well. He really wants the students to do well. Great Prof!"", ""Absolutely the worst professor I have ever had.  Class structure: 10 mins of looking at the calendar, 30 mins repeating the last lecture, 10 mins maybe getting to something new.  Only likes to hear his own ideas but won't explain himself half the time, leaving you in a tricky spot for midterms and essays. Ruined classical mythology for me."", 'I think Dr. O\'Brien is a great prof. He\'s obviously very brilliant and he\'s very helpful, although I do find his lectures get very repetitive and a bit dry. He also has a problem with saying ""uh, um, like"" alot. But whenever he introduces new topic he\'s always interesting. Not to mention he\'s pretty smokin\'.']",4.2,"['awesome', 'awesome', 'awesome', 'awesome', 'awesome', 'awful', 'average', 'awesome', 'average', 'awful', 'awesome', 'awesome', 'awesome', 'average', 'awesome', 'average', 'awful', 'awesome', 'awful', 'awesome']","['4.0', '4.0', '5.0', '5.0', '5.0', '1.0', '3.5', '5.0', '3.5', '2.5', '4.5', '5.0', '4.0', '3.5', '5.0', '3.5', '1.0', '4.5', '1.0', '4.0']"
