I couldn't understand anything. Go to class & try to take good notes."", ""This professor is particularly hard to follow. His lectures are mostly full of irrelevant information and does not provide a good way of understanding the needed knowledge for exams. very hard to keep interest. He expects a lot of reading, and when i say a lot, i mean a LOT. but i'm sure you can get by without, i did."", 'he gets pissed when you dont understand his mumbo-jumbo indian-english speak. i feel like im trying to learn public administration from a wookie.im being literal when i say this: if you raise your hand because you cant understand what the **** hes saying, he will try to embarrass you in front of the entire class', 'I hated this class. It was so boring and very hard. Luckly I was in my senior year and information that I had learned in other classes helped me on the tests. I would recommend avoiding him if possible.

All tests are taken exactly from his notes. NO need to read the book.', ""Very hard to understand and the stories are annoying and causing our class to fall behind!
