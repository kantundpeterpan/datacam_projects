Especially helpful to those first years who didnt take grade 11 or 12 physics. Go to class because physics is really hard and she explains things well and is always willing to answer questions."", 'Decent prof although I found myself skipping many of her lectures to learn the material on my own (I only recommend doing this if you can study independently). Do every problem in the study guide, ace your 5 quizzes and 5 EWAs, and you walk into the final with a 68%. Be sure to learn the last unit on nuclear physics before the exam (25 fair MC #s).', ""Omeara was a lifesaver. Made not taking any physics in highschool really worth it I finished with a A easily. Study for the quizzes and you are guaranteed a pass. Exam was fair but difficult, she cares about the students and learning from them as well. She's super approachable and funny and made waking up for her class really worth it."", ""One of the best professors with a great personality. She's caring, nice, and fair.

In hschool it was my worst course and I hated it. The opposite for uni!!"", 'Amazing prof!! Speaks clearly and loud. I love the fact that she writes big too, her examples are great. There is honestly nothing bad I could ever say, she is like a perfect prof. I wish I could take more upper year classes with her, definitely recommend her. One of my favourite profs.', 'Very enthusiastic about her lecture examples. She creates physics problems that are solved as a class during lecture.

Approachable', 'Amazing prof, uses a lot of examples', 'Fantastic teacher, very clear and concise lectures with an extremely lenient marking process.  The class consists of five quizzes each worth 10% and you have three tries to get at least an 8/10 then you receive the full 10%. EWA optional homework and labs, each worth 8% and 10% respectively are essentially free marks. Overall, fairly easy.', 'She is super a super nice prof, and teaches the course extremely very well, similar to highschool. This course is very easy to pass, as there is 50% in quizzes, 8% of optional homework (5 tries/question), and 10% in labs (100% if you show up). Most people go into exam with automatic 68%, meaning you pass the course going into the exam! Great course', ""O'Meara made it worth not taking physics in grade 12! I did better in her class than I would have in gr 12, in fact the class brought my average up. She posts her notes online every class and goes through LOTS of example questions.
