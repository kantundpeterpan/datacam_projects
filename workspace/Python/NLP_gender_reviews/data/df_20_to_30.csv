I would take him again if I could, such a great experience', ""Sociology course masquerading as a business capstone. If you're a bleeding heart liberal who wants to circlejerk over social justice for an hour and fifteen take his course. With that said I think he's a good speaker, but his lectures are pure fluff."", ""The enthusiasm displayed in every single class. It was one of the few classes that held my attention throughout the class period. The ratio between the real life examples and going through material related to readingexams was great! Didn't read from the bookppt, and didn't get off topic either.  3 exams,  56 quizzes and one paper. "", ""Good lecturer...and that is about it. He is a lazy or overworked professor. Current MBA director, and doesn't even use moodle or reply to emails. His grading on papers doesn't have a real rubric. He gives the grade he wants based on how he likes you. Kohut, you are not fooling anyone. You act like you are open minded, but you are just like the rest"", ""Class was very enjoyable.  He keeps the class lively and actively involves students in the class.  He's demanding & challenges you, but that's what a graduate class should be.  Highly recommend taking a class with him"", ""He will not acknowledge your effort. Very particular about essay writing and will take a lot of points off your essay for trivial stuff like page number and headings. I don't recommend Kohut."", ""Great Professor.  If you put in effort you can definitely get a good grade if not an A. Book used is clear and interesting as well. A discussion based class, so be ready to talk! I'd definitely take a class from him again."", 'GREAT PROFESSOR!! Difficult class, but very interesting. One of the most difficult classes I have taken, but definitely recommend taking. Very fair grader also.  Speak up in class, he will remember', ""Professor is extrememly helpful and has a teaching style that is very different from most professors. Makes classroom interaction mandatory by randomly calling on students which I think is very helpful. I didn't receive a 'A' in the class (a 'B' instead) but the grading was very fair. His test are a little tough but overall a great teacher!"", ""Great class, great teacher, fair grader... he'll keep your attention and will engage your interest."", ""AWESOME, AWESOME, AWESOME professor. Best one I've had at UNCC in 5.5 years. Tough but fair. Expects a lot from his students, but gives a lot when you show you are trying and doing your work. Makes a really boring class super interesting and fun. I wish he taught a class that taught other professors how to properly teach!"", ""ROCKS! He is the best & most engaging teacher i've at this University.  Every teacher should be made to teach like him. He is tuff but you learn a lot from real world examples. I read the chapters and attended lectures and got an A. He is friendly but believes in making you accountable for your work. I like that."", 'Attending his class discussions, reading the book, and outlining will NOT get you an A on the exam unless you have a photographic memory.  He plays favoritism, which is horrible when he grades your essay questions.', 'He makes class very interesting.  He keeps you involved, but his grading is arbitrary.  He has his favorites and grades that way.  Overall, I learned alot and I enjoyed his class.', 'Honestly the best professor I had and it took my senior year to get him. His style to teach is untraditional, no power points just discussion. His discussions are entertaining yet educational. I am not an A student very average  and received a B in this course. Gives bonuses questions to make up for his 10 quizzes  which counts as a test. Take him', 'DO NOT take this professor!  He is mean to his students and makes class a chore.  Plays favoritism but you can probably pass his tests.', 'I agree.', 'you might think you r the luckiest to have him, but guys, think outside the box. he would answer your question after you turn the assignment. never ever try to talk to him about your situation because he doesnt care, he might seems like he does. you will work really hard to earn each point and he will be more than happy to take 20 points for nothin', 'Great professor, very helpful, applies material to real-life scenarios, makes you think about things in a different light, I am more prepared for the business-world after this class.  Tests are easy but he grades speeches and assignments pretty harshly.', ""Had 3 written assignments, 2 presentations, 3 tests (grades 2 highest), and a group paper. He's very critical on papers, taking off points for the smallest of errors. Allows questioning after test but he is still right, and you're still wrong. His lectures are interesting and engaging. Class isn't hard, just a lot of work to do.""]",3.6,"['awesome', 'awful', 'awesome', 'awful', 'awesome', 'awful', 'awesome', 'awesome', 'awesome', 'awesome', 'awesome', 'awesome', 'awful', 'awesome', 'awesome', 'awful', 'awful', 'awful', 'awesome', 'average']","['5.0', '2.5', '4.5', '2.5', '5.0', '1.5', '5.0', '5.0', '4.5', '5.0', '5.0', '4.0', '1.5', '4.0', '5.0', '1.0', '1.0', '1.0', '5.0', '3.5']"
