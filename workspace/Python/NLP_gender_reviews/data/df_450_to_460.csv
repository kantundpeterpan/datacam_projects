Views that go against hers are shot down/not given much attention. Also, her questions are so vague it's absolutely unclear to know how she wants us to respond, which is kind of important when she just wants to hear her opinion. The essays are okay though."", 'Literary and Cultural Analysis. She joked at the beginning of the year about how ""blunt"" she is, but she\'s honestly just rude. She likes to ask super vague questions and then mock us for how slow we all are when we don\'t respond. Very pretentious. Luckily she\'s an easy grader on the  assignments.', ""Bannet's great!  She can be a bit intimidating in the beginning, but her bluntness is just a part of her personality and if you embrace it, you'll actually find she's pretty funny and amiable; rambles, but she encourages interjections to remedy this; Work load for an Intro. course is VERY doable and she's loose about grades anyway. I give her an A!"", 'The class was dull in and of itself, but easy. Every class consists of a discussion over the reading material. There were 2 papers and 2 tests. If you are a half decent writer and want an easy class to fulfill the arts requirement, take it.', 'She let us make an honest attempt to redo any paper that we failed to get right the first time, and was extremely approachable during her office hours. I felt she truly took an interest in me as well as my struggles with the class content.  She did not try to candy coat the degree of difficulty, but did make it possible to succeed with hard work.', 'She is the best professor that I have ever had during undergraduate work! Dr. Bannett is intelligent and experienced in English literature. Her selection of Katherine Mansfield to supplement theory was absolutely brilliant and entertaining! Make sure that you have done your reading before class. Effort and a relaxed personality will serve you well.', ""I was lost in the discussion (or lack of) every class, and the other students I spoke with shared the same level of confusion.  This class required a lot of effort (and a lot of revision b/c of her lack of clarity) just to get a decent grade.  It was an experience I'd like to forget."", 'Great teacher, a bit intimidating but totally worth it.', 'Dr. Bannet assigns a lots of reading and proposes to encourage free thinking. However, her management of classtime and her disconcerting facial expressions make this not a reality. Good prof, but alarmingly pretentious.', 'Really great professor!  She encourages discussion and understands that students have lives outside of the classroom.  She makes the class interesting and is really cool about attendance and if you are late handing in an assignment or behind on the reading a bit.', 'excellent - the course covered all aspects of the Enlightnement, and Prof. Bannet provoked insightful and stimulating discussions. pretentious she is not.', 'No Comments', ""It's like an Oprah's bookclub meeting over totally boring books. I hate it!"", 'Her class was quite dull.  She has difficulty entertaining viewpoints that differ from her own, making for very tiring discussions.  She seemed too busy for her students much of the time.', 'No Comments', 'Brit Lit and Senior Capstone...Terrible courses. I learned very little of importance. Very pretentious and rude. Dull, dull, dull! She picks favorites, and is insanely obvious about it. I HATED her classes...nothing but high-minded, post-modernist babble.', 'No Comments', 'No Comments', 'seems intelligent but class moves too quickly for good discussion']",3,"['awful', 'awful', 'average', 'average', 'awesome', 'awesome', 'awful', 'average', 'awful', 'awesome', 'awesome', 'awesome', 'awesome', 'awful', 'awful', 'awful', 'awful', 'awful', 'awful', 'average']","['1.0', '2.0', '3.5', '3.5', '4.5', '4.5', '1.5', '3.0', '2.5', '5.0', '4.0', '4.0', '5.0', '2.5', '2.0', '2.5', '1.5', '2.5', '2.5', '3.5']"
