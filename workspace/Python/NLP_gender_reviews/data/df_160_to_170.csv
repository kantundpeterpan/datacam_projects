Maybe this course could be useful but it won't be with Phil teaching it."", 'The course is a breeze, unless you have never seen a computer before.

Just do all your work and do a bunch of volunteer works to get BONUS marks.  Only one thing that annoys me is that he never answer my questions.  Like I asked him a question, he always answers something else that is totally different from what I've asked."", ""Excellent prof!! Don't take the course if you are proficient with computers as you won't gain anything from the course.

Good material and good coverage of it."", 'He is the rudest, most imbecilique, anti-pedagogical excuse for a teacher I have ever met. I feel sorry for his children.

He is a real jerk, and his class is a HUGE waste of time and money. Don't take it unless it's required for your program. I wish I had never taken it. Live and learn I guess."", ""Yes he may be rude & his course has nothin 2 do w/comps, but the main reason he teaches is to inspire us to live. I realized after the first class that I wanted to live my life based on my passion, not on what I can do.

Whatever it was I didn't like it, so I dropped immediately."", ""Terrible teacher! He cant explain things. The lecture moves way too fast and he has very bad hand writing.

He gives lectures by writing on the digital projector.  His handwriting is terrible and you can easily fall behind when he moves the paper up too quickly.

You really can't read any of his writing."", 'The class overall is very hard and then add that with his inability to teach the material.
