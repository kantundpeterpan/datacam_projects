He's too old to teach, he should retire already!"", 'very boring class, he has to curve all the grades to make himself look good. no one is going to pass this class this semester.

He is very knowledgeble and good at explaining the material.  He is not easy though.  Tests were tough and he assigns a lot of HW', 'I had this with him last fall. He is very difficult and not willing to help much with homework questions. Assigns massive amounts of homework sometimes on stuff not even covered in class. Tests are very hard, study a lot and you might get a decent grade. 60% fail rate among students unless you are a dorky genius. Take with someone else!!', ""Despite what I read, Reid isn't that bad. i had somewhat of an advantage b/c I had to retake essentially the same course,but it's a hard class to pass in general. 3 tests, hw, and a final. Was able to get a C w/o doing practically any hw, but just b/c I knew some of the material already."", ""I'm not going to argue that he doesn't understand calculus; the problem is that he isn't any good at explaining the procedure.  His class sessions typically consist of one example after another, but there is very little explanation for the procedure itself, so you're basically left to try and parrot a procedure without knowing what you're doing."", 'DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR - possibly he is a good mathematician or scholar but as a teacher he is atrocious. The very worst instructor I have ever had in any subject at any level. Period.', ""It has been said that this class is the highest failed class and this teacher doesn't make it any easier.

He's really nice though, and if you email to ask him for help he'll help you."", 'It is extremely difficult to understand what this man is saying. During the first few weeks, all I heard was whispers and mumbles. I started to get used to the way he talked, though, and he became easier to understand.

Didn't go to class and read the work on my own, and passed. Do not take him unless you can sit through pointless lectures and then go home and reread everything you did in class!"", 'Jerry is great!! If you attend class you will do fine on the tests. He goes over all the readings in great detail. So you will do good on the test. His tests are easy. He can be unclear at times but its not to bad.

His tests have lots of options so if you do not know something you can skip it. You do group presentaions so you understand better.
