If you skip class, you will pay for it.', ""Professor speaks clearly and you can actually understand him. His course notes were amazing so you didn't need to take notes in his class. Exams are fairly hard. However, the prof will not accommodating at all and you will have to live with whatever he gives you."", ""The course notes look like they've been written by a crackhead chicken, and he keeps switching notation. He talks way too fast during lectures. Labs are interesting, and exams are like the assignment questions, except harder."", 'Absolutely fantastic prof. It was his first time teaching the course, and he still pulled it off well (Julie Vale (TA) helped out). Very friendly, helpful, and approachable, with entertaining lectures - he has a ton of stories to relate control systems to everything from cows to rockets to the stock market. His corny jokes are the best. Fair exams.', 'Not nice to students when asked for help. Everytime I had an appointment with him at the engineering office, I was pissed off.', ""good fair teacher... but looks like he's ready to bite my head off with the way he stares with those beedy EYES!!!!!"", 'The good - fairly organized.  The bad - talks way too fast.  The ugly - tells lots of stories about cows.', 'Talks too fast.  Too many proofs and not enough application.', 'Tough prof. Slightly less evil than Barby.', ""Excellent prof.  Super clear.  Material is hard and the course moves really fast, but he's really good at teaching it.

Rather he sees  exams as some kind of bell-curve which would be ruined if all understood the material.', ""Very passionate about what he teaches and he gets the point across really well. Make sure you attend class and pay close attention throughout all the lectures.
