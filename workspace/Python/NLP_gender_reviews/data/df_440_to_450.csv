I LOVE this funny old teacher! he makes everyone laugh in class and loves making fun of students (i think its his hobby!) but yeah he rocks our math class. Best Math teacher i ever had', 'This guy is tooo funny!! He explains everything over and over and over again, so everyone leaves having a clue!!! NO homework except for study questions for test! Test question are almost the exact ones on the study guide!!', 'he makes fun of students constantly, and is a pretty funny character. gives homework, never collects it. great professor, a C or less would be a sin', ""he is a great teacher and explains things well, the only problem is he likes to make everyone in class uncomfortable and squirming. if you don't mind being treated like a fool and getting called names take him! you will do well"", 'he is a easy teacher and does explain things well, i had in for finite and the course work was easy, he gives you practice tests and the actual tests are almost identical, He can be funny, take him for finite math']",4.5,"['awful', 'awesome', 'awesome', 'awesome', 'awesome', 'awesome', 'awesome', 'awful', 'awesome', 'awesome', 'awesome', 'awesome', 'awesome', 'awesome', 'awesome', 'awesome', 'awesome', 'awesome', 'awesome', 'awesome']","['1.0', '4.5', '5.0', '4.0', '5.0', '4.0', '5.0', '2.5', '4.5', '4.5', '5.0', '5.0', '4.5', '5.0', '4.5', '5.0', '4.0', '4.0', '5.0', '5.0']"

If you take this class be prepared to work though, it is not for slackers. midterm and final were take home papers so that was good, and 7 response papers. Assigns a lot of readings, and 20 page research  papers is rough but he helps you along the way with suggestions. You get what you earn here.', ""Prof.Polsky is THE BEST prof. at Hunter.He is funny and extremely smart.He made me regret choosing sociology as my major instead of political science.His readings and lectures are very entertaining and exams are straight forward.I'm very upset I found him when I'm done with my undergrad courses.Take him, he makes you fall in love with learning."", ""This professor knows what he is talking about. However, I found attending his class very unnecessary. Class is pretty boring. Your main resource are the TA's. Not a hard class, just take two exams, do the work, and tada- A!"", 'Tough class. The exams have nothing to do with the notes. You can not go to a single lecture like I did, and end up with a B. The biggest issue with this class is if you want to learn anything, you have to take notes like crazy as Polsky does not upload them anywhere else. Often, Polsky goes through topics very quickly and briefly talks about them.', ""This guy has his lecture memorized, and restricts questions until a designated time.  Completely the OPPOSITE of interactive - I have no idea how he has so many good ratings.  Boring, rote, and not personable. It's as if a math professor is teaching a history class. His veneers are bangin tho."", 'Lectures are very interesting and makes the class interesting with side jokes. Attending lectures is important since there is no textbook to study from, just his in-class notes. Only 1 paper per week and one paper.

Must really study and go to recitations and lectures in order to succeed in this course.', 'Knowledgable lectures, MUST READ HIS PUBLISHED WORK,OUTSTANDING. My T.A was very helpful and enthusiastic, good luck on getting a good T.A', 'Polsky is actually very good professor, but that fact that his class is a lecture makes takes away from his teaching. If you are genuinely interested in the subject, you will do great, if not, this class might be a challenge. The readings are ridic but if you take the time they are not so bad. Polsky is very clear and well informed in his topic.', 'Polsky is such a great lecturer. He knows very well what he is talking about and can answer any question thrown at him. He is extremely fair and is clear with what he expects. May be a lot of reading, but not so much when spread out. Not a class to fall back on readings/miss lectures.Cares about his students and helps them out. Definitely recommend', ""The best political science professor I've had at Hunter. His lectures are informative and interesting. He is always open to student participation. His tests are fair, he gives you a list of essay questions and picks three on the test. You have to answer two.  His readings are interesting as well."", ""He's awesome! A truly great professor who values the opinion of each student, not bias, answers questions clearly, interesting lectures--I can't wait to take him again!"", 'i recommend anyone to take a class with polsky. hes a great professor, he really knows his stuff. i hate politics and anything to do with it, but i survived with a B+, borderline A! its easy to pass with a great grade even if you have no knowledge of political science, like me!', ""Professor Polsky is an amazing professor. Not only is he the head of the Political Science department, but he makes you feel like you're intelligent. No question is unanswerable for him and he is simply amazing. Take any class that he lectures. He's organized and structured and really wants the students he teaches to excel in their education."", 'he is very good and makes the lecture alive.if you ever have questions he always answer them. there is 3 test and one paper (which you can rewrite to get a better grade) and lowest grade is dropped.', 'Polsky is clear, funny, and extremely interesting.', 'Professor Polsky is hands down the best professor I have ever had.
