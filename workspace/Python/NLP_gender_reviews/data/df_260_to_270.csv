Be warned.', ""Will mark you to filth on seemingly inconsequential details, so study hard and study ~everything~; don't take the course unless you're interested in geology. Will jump through hoops and spend hours helping students. Dr. McBride is a delight to have as a Prof!"", ""Geol 104 is a LOT to learn in 1 semester as it used to be a full year course and it is now condensed into a half year. Interesting if you like Geology, though I wouldn't recommend the course as an elective.  A decent mark is achievable, though she is an extremely tough marker and small details are included on tests and exams."", ""Dr McBride is such a sweetheart! She is knowledgeable, and a passionate professor. Tests cover EVERYTHING, but aren't hard if you go to all lectures and labs. She cares about her students and is always available for questions. She gives you all her notes at the start of the year so you can listen in class. Pay attention to her diagrams!"", ""McBride is an absolute gem!! Such a great prof, and so passionate about what she does. She is truly dedicated to helping you succeed if you show any effort and excitement at all.

Easy marks if you commit yourself to the work. Tests were hard but fair, and easy to anticipate what material would be on them. DO go to class and DO attend labs', ""Difficult exams and tests, but Dr. McBride really cares about students. Don't skip a single lecture or a single lab.

She can be helpful but also got the impression she felt I was wasting her time. Lectures were clear and organized', 'Dr McBride tells you exactly what will be on the test. It is very important to attend the lectures, because she adds information that you cannot otherwise find in the text or in the notes.

Extremely well-prepared (once her computer malfunctioned, and she was ready with back-up overhead slides). Explained concepts clearly with diagrams, and very helpful & approachable.
