He hardly ever used the book (so i dont recommend buying one) and he made writting papers a breeze with his method of teaching.

9,https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/professor?tid=57861,"[""Great professor, passionate what he teaches. Grades consist of four tests which are not too hard to study for since they're more based around his lectures than the text book and he usually gives away a few answers in his review days. There are also two essays which are fairly easy to do well on. An enjoyable class for those interested in history."", ""Be ready on reading alot of chapters and write everything that he says in lecture. His tests are not easy and will make you think critically and they are  based on the combination of reading the  book and lectures. Good note-taking is a must! And also there's  2 papers you need to write for this class. Do all these things and you should get an A."", 'I enjoyed his class.  But I must agree with many others, his tests are based on his understanding of his lectures and they do tend to go off course.  All in All he is a good professor, just pay attention and think outside of the box.', ""A funny guy who's lectures are interesting and informative, but sometimes he'll go off topic for a while. Overall a good teacher, he's very clear about grading and you've got nothing to worry about if you keep up with the reading."", 'Professor OBrien is a great professor. He is very clear on what he expects. There are 2 Essays and 2 Exams. He does kind of go all over the place and gets off track, but hes very helpful.

He is very quick to', ""Listen attentively in class, study your notes, & do the book review, there is no reason you can't pass this class w a B. I hated history in hs. I was not looking forward to having to take it in college. He obviously loves history and teaches it like a story without focusing on little details like dates; instead he wants you to get the big picture."", '4 exams, multiple choice with written essay.  He provides essay question before exam. Tests off his lectures, but not everything from lecture is on exam. He is not structured and can get off topic easily. Does not teach from the book and I do not like that. However, everyone learns differently. Overall, a good professor.', ""Great professor. Get in, get the info you need, and get out. Very good at pointing out the info you will need on the test. Passed without buying the book, but I am a good note taker. Reasonable tests (4 I think), and no quizzes that I can remember. One essay if you want a grade above a 'C'"", ""I had no desire, whatsoever, to take this class. Very fortunate, that I ended up taking him.

I found the material entertaining and interesting. He would tell you the stories with enthusiasm and if you have fun listening to the subject you'll enjoy it.

While the majority of his test material does come straight from his lectures, some of the material on the tests are never discussed in lectures.  An A in this class is next to impossible!!', ""Had a great time in this class. I took notes every class and recorded his lectures. I recommend doing this. He can get a little off topic from time to time but the lectures are interesting. He is a cool guy and makes the material not so dry. I work and go to school full time and didn't have any problems. I'm taking him again forthe next section"", 'The class is simple and he makes his test soley on the information that he lectures about. However much of the information that he talks about is irrelevant, therefore you have to pick and choose the information that is useful. He is a really nice guy and a reasonable person. the test, curriculum and grading system is a little poorly put together.', ""Awesome class! Bought the book but hardly read...Taking notes and listening well in class was all it took for me to pull a solid B. He reviews for tests and pretty much lets you know what you need to know. He's pretty funny sometimes i suggest his class for History 1"", ""Agreed with the comment below. Many of the questions on his tests are up to his interpretation. In other words, it doesn't really matter how much you study or take notes -- if you don't understand history as he does, it's much harder to get an A. Still, a B isn't that hard to get in his class."", 'dont take!!!!', ""honestly, i don't recommend this professor if you want an easy A or B. you have to read a LOT if you want to get a good grade. he's a nice guy though. i looked at the ratings on this site and registered, but i really regret it. i had to withdraw, and got a W on my transcript. after the first test he told us that most students either got an A or F:/"", ""Good guy. Took for 5 week session during the summer. 3 tests and two had a little bit of writing on them. I didn't read the textbook at all after chapter 1 and still got an A.
