Simply put, he doesn't teach and just rambles on about completely unrelated stories. Gives the exam questions out beforehand, so why bother even going to class?! I didn't learn a thing from that man."", 'I love this man. His stories are hilarious and while I thought he was crazy and boring at the beginning of the class I grew to love him and ended up doing really well. He also wears great hats.', ""Excellent dresser. G.E. Tucker epitomizes for me what Professor should be and do. His lectures encourage students to think deeply about politics and how we as humans make decisions. Tucker's fortÃ\x83Â© is certainly one on one or small group conversations in his office. Take the time to get to know him - he'll teach you about philosophy and life!"", ""definitely an excellent teacher and a really nice man.  he's the one you want if you like to come up with your own stuff.  but don't take him for an easy class.  he does go off on tangents and if you haven't kept up with the material enough to know what's going on you'll be bored."", ""Good professor and a very approachable person. Learn to love his stories and his so called off topic ramblings; they've all got a meaning"", ""he gives the exam questions out before the exam so you don't really need to go to class during the semester, can be a bit boring. he starts off the class with good points but goes on a lot of tangents once students start asking questions. i liked the material covered in the course though."", ""As a prof, he's really funny and smart, but he's a little hard to understand if you're not used to the way he talks (kinda reminds me of Milton from the movie Office Space). Be warned: he will go over the same stuff about 1000 times and sometimes he seems like he hasn't prepared for the lectures."", 'Very non-linear as one mentioned and an intellectual but not necessarily a perfectly practical lecturer.  He has tangents but there absolutely hilarious, and often very interesting.  Love the one about being stopped on the autobahn in Germany', 'Epitomizes the title teacher. Non conventional and truly a provocateur. An intellectual not an academic functionary.', ""I've taken many classes with Dr. Tucker.  He is the best professor I have had at Bishop's  The problem is, especially for first years, he's a litle nonlinear.  However, if you actually listen to any of his sidetrips and tangents, they are ALL relevant !"", 'Not a good teacher as he lets students dictate and over run the flow of the lectures. Mid terms, finals, and essays are easy, general grading is good.', 'mmmm ok in general .... good in his own way', ""GHe's very approachable and easy to talk with, and he enjoys teaching! Lectures can get off topic and boring sometimes, but he's got a wealth of information.
