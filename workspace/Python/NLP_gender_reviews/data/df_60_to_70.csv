It's week 5 and professor Obrien is one of the most sincere, organized professionals I have ever had. I almost dindt take her because of the comments. Glad I didnt listen to any of you. I would take her class. Great story teller and personality. What is wrong with everyone??"", 'I took her for Consulting. She is an extremely caring person. She will help you with any topic (class related or not.)She loves what she teaches and you can tell. Sometimes she yells and gets into her speeches, but that is what keeps you interested. Class work is light and easy- I would take her again.', ""She's very intelligent and obviously knows what she's talking about but is a terrible teacher. She is demeaning and is extremely unhelpful. Enroll at your own risk. I made the mistake of taking her twice and I will never do it again. If you don't mind being talked down to, this is your kind of teacher."", ""I made the mistake of taking her twice.She's annoying, thinks that putting slides on BBoard is the work of the devil, & very nit-picky on the stupidest crap.She assigns & expects you to start work on final project 1st day of class(seriously).By end of course you'll have about 40,000 handouts.Just not a good prof at all. AVOID IF AT ALL POSSIBLE!"", ""Horrible teacher.  She seems nice at first but she's not.  She's annoying and mean."", ""Does DePaul have any quality control?  Why is this person allowed to teach anyone about anything?  I have no idea what she knows or why she's allowed to work at a university."", ""Sweet person but gets annoying at times with her tone of voice. You take notes all period long. Doesnt use blackboard and at the end of the quarter has two major assignments and final due, so you're left trying to guess your grade. If you can deal with that then take her class because it is really interesting."", ""Having taken other CMN profs, I am sorry to say that this woman is probably the worst. She did not help with any questions, and nothing was interesting. Plus she sounds like a cartoon character and thinks she's funny when she's doing it. Avoid this teacher like the plague."", ""boring. her stories are dumb. don't relate to class. at least i was able to get stuff done for other classes in this class."", 'No Comments', ""Yes, her voice is annoying...but what's even worse is how she can go from a normal speaking voice to screaming/screaching with no warning.  Most of what is said in class is word-for-word in the book...such a boring class"", ""Dr. O'Brien was so-so.  She mentioned many times she does not have much time because she teaches so many classes and other students.  Material is so-so, tests are not hard if you study - paper grade was a little harsh, and yes she does have a very high pitched screachy voice that she tends to use when telling a story...very weird, actually."", 'I liked this class because we got to talk in group circles but the teacher was unbearable sometimes.
