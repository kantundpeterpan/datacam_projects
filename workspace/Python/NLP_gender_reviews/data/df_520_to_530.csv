It wasn't until after the term that I appreciated what he taught me. I'm not as passive as I used to be thanks to prof. Day encouraging critical analysis. You just have to get passed his unique personality. I would definitely take another course with him."", ""Avoid at all costs. Confusing lectures and confusing personality. He states he's not allowed to have an opinion as a prof, but asks questions on the exam about his PERSONAL opinion. Got by in the course only because the information was easy to understand."", ""Day is not your typical Queen's prof- he rocks up to lecture in cargo pants and a hoodie.
