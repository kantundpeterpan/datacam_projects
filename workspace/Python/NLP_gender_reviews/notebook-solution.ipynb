Studies have shown that gender bias in language can have a significant impact on the way people are perceived and treated. \n\nFor example, research has found that job advertisements that use masculine-coded language tend to attract more male applicants, while those that use feminine-coded language tend to attract more female applicants. Similarly, gendered language can perpetuate differences in the classroom.\n\nIn this project, we'll using scraped student reviews from [ratemyprofessors.com](https://ratemyprofessors.com) to identify differences in language commonly used for male vs. female professors, and explore subtleties in how language in the classroom can be gendered.\n\nThis excellent [tool](https://benschmidt.org/profGender/#%7B%22database%22%3A%22RMP%22%2C%22plotType%22%3A%22pointchart%22%2C%22method%22%3A%22return_json%22%2C%22search_limits%22%3A%7B%22word%22%3A%5B%22aggressive%22%5D%2C%22department__id%22%3A%7B%22%24lte%22%3A25%7D%2C%22rHelpful%22%3A%5B1%2C2%5D%2C%22rClarity%22%3A%5B1%2C2%5D%7D%2C%22aesthetic%22%3A%7B%22x%22%3A%22WordsPerMillion%22%2C%22y%22%3A%22department%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22gender%22%7D%2C%22counttype%22%3A%5B%22WordsPerMillion%22%5D%2C%22groups%22%3A%5B%22department%22%2C%22gender%22%5D%2C%22testGroup%22%3A%22C%22%7D) created by Ben Schmidt allows us to enter the words and phrases that we find in our analysis and explore them in more depth.

Web scraping can be a helpful data collection tool when datasets are unable for this kind of work. We can write web scrapers to compile datasets on job descriptions, freelancer reviews, and, as in our use-case, professor reviews by students.\n\n[ratemyprofessors.com](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/professor?tid=589) provides an insightful combination of qualitative and quantitative metrics that we can analyze.\n\nAlthough the data on their websites is not labeled by gender, we'll use pronouns used by students to label professors \"Male\" or \"Female\". Of course, this approach is not perfect, as it relies on the _students'_ use of pronouns. Professors with non-binary pronouns will also be under-represented in the data, since very few reviews will have them, and so it's not trivial to write an algorithm to detect them.

Overall he's a really great prof with a lot of knowledge about what he's teaching.","Great class, great content, good prof.

Class participation is also recommended","There are many baooks to read in this course. Lovejoy really expects you to know all of them inside and out. The final exam is worth 60% and is super hard.","I watch every week for a new sweater! Absolutely love the sweaters. Class is good, kind of boring... but he knows what hes taking about and DETAILS (!!!!!) are important to know of the books... read carefully, and you will be fine. the book sate enjoyable so its a little easier....","just an okay class. heavy reading load and fairly interesting lectures but if it didn't go into any depth over the changes over time in children's lit or any threories etc that could have been applied to the class. would be a much better class if it wasn't so large and through CUTV. i wish there was a follow up upper year class!","For the person who wrote the 8/30/06 comment:  perhaps you should learn how to spell before insulting a professor...I mean \"thoroghly\"??

Don't expect it to get complex...it's children's lit!!!!","A great class. The reading was engaging. Does a good job of pointing out the complexities in books that are assumed to be simple. Lovejoy is so laid back his lectures are like a good chat over coffee. Truly enjoyable.","Likes to show pictures and ramble on about things that have nothing to do with the books content or the exam.  Have to know specifics about the book or your gonna be lost.

His lectures are interesting, especially because he cracks jokes the whole time and sometimes relates them to stuff he has done in the past. I'm sad to see him retire but hope he comes back for an occasional lecture!","Easiest class I've taken. It's a pass/fail class based only on attendence so as long as you show up and at least write your name on the in class assignment (even if you hand it in blank) you will pass. Only a few homework assignments that are easy and you get a 100 as long as you do it. He rambles on during class but you dont even have to listen.","This felt more like a military recruiting class more than a psychology course. Barker just rambles on about random stuff that has nothing to do with the course. He was supposed to give us advice about graduate school but I could've gotten more information on the internet. Pointless class.","It isnt that I hated him, I just felt like you had to be high to make it through his class. He goes off topic a lot and he is so incredibly negative to the point I wanted to do something. For Orientation to Psych, you must attend class because it is a passfail class. He was rather confusing on some stuff and we hardly ever got through a powerpoint","His tests are taken straight from the book, not lectures.  READ THE BOOK and you should pass.  The lectures kind of pertain to the tests but just enough so that if you don't attend you'll miss enough questions on the test to not make an A. His final is super easy ONLY IF you attend a majority of classes. It is a hard class, I had to work for a B. ","Incoherent ramblings that are often off topic. Lectured us with a lecture that was meant for another class. Test questions are tricky and plan on seeing items on the exam that are not mentioned in class or on the power point. Read the book I love psychology but this class bores me out of my mind","Dr Barker was an ok teacher however the class was by far the hardest class i have ever taken in my life. The test questions didn't come from the book nor the notes.The four thousand word essay was so hard even if you start early. When ask how to study for his yes/no final he replied 'I guess just looked through the book'.This class was my first C.","For an 8AM class, this was GREAT! Dr. Barker is funny, entertaining, a fair grader, and always helpful. He likes people who speak up in class, and you have to read the book to get good grades on the weekly quizzes. Read the chapters on your own, then study with someone in the class and talk through the chapter to prepare. Great class! Take him!","Barker is a fantastic teacher. He is absolutely fun, makes everything interesting and is fascinating to talk to. Go to class, do your reading and really engage yourself in the discussions. Go see him for office hours, he'll do anything he can to help you out if you show you're interested. Really great teacher. I'd take him again.","He is a great person!  The weekly quizzes become a little bit of a hassle, but I still think it is better to have a bunch of little grades, each are worth 20 pts, than two or three huge test in case you have an off week.  You also get to drop the three lowest quizzes.  Read the book!! and you will be fine!","Barker is an awesome teacher. At first, I was overwhelmed by the weekly quizzes but they get easier as you go on. Just read the chapters and LEARN THE VOCAB. Go to his office hours and you'll find out what a helpful guy he really is. I definintely recommend this teacher. We're in college to learn, aren't we?","You should definitely take this class! I had it at 8am and it was my favorite class. You might be overwhelmed at first but all you need to do is read the chapter before each quiz. All of your grades come from quizzes and a paper. Dr. Barker is awesome and loves psyc. He will definitely go out of his way if you need help. TAKE THIS CLASS!","Barker is hilarious. He makes the class less boring than it normally would be (all you talk about is basic psych, no detailed stuff). READ THE BOOK for quizzes, and you'll be fine. He has some weird testing methods so look out for those. For example, \"which of these words is a real psychology term\" and a list of 150 words was our final.","If you're taking the honors section, go to class, read the book 2 or 3 times before each quiz (one every other class), and you'll be fine. In class he basically rambles and tells funny stories, so there's really no point in focusing. Sometimes he'll give you quiz answers if everyone else is asleep.. This is a good class to take. A relatively easy A","if you want to hear ALL, I do mean ALL, about evolution of man, take the class.  He never tied anything into sports psych.  BIGGEST waste of time and money...and i was pumped about class, until the 1st day!","He was very interested in the material, good considering he wrote our textbook. However, class time was a waste. We just discussed vaguely related things. Luckily this did not affect our grades because we took the chapter/reading quiz first and there were no \"tests.\" Read and an A is not hard. Do not start a debate with him, just don't.","dr. b. is hilarious. i've had him for 3 classes so far, gotten C's, but i've really learned alot. if i went to class everyday and applied myself more then i'd probly would've gotten an A. just keep up, the paper for bx'al neuroscience isn't manadantory anymore,if you like psyc then go for it! he means well, but he will DEF. embarrass u!just laugh:)","I took this class for an easy A and I got a C... I studied more for this class than I did Biology and I made a B in that class... NOT A GOOD CLASS TO TAKE! He takes attendance everyday and going to class is pointless because it dosnt help...

He doesn't do reviews, the tests are 70- 75 questions each and lab practicals are hard.  He doesn't tell you what to study for or any hints so, ur basically screwed.  You can survive with AT MOST a B. If ur not skilled in BIO, don't take him, he will wreck ur GPA. Find another science class and don't take him BIO is not easy","Stay away.Take him only if you're good in bio and chem.

Couldn't understand majority of the lecture. It's hard. Take him if u want to challenge yourself...","This class felt like a slow and painful death. Death would actually be better than taking this horrific class again. Never in my life have I worked harder and with no results. He has to be the worst professor I have ever encountered. He is in his own little worls and speaks to students like they are all Nobel prize candidates. AVOID","Honestly, taking this class is the biggest regret of my school career. You will work like a slave and only end up with average grades.  He has no respect for the students and seems to not get the idea that some of us have up to 4 other classes. My grades in others classes definitely suffered because I was wasting my time studying for this class.","He's a goo d professor and since I don't really enjoy the sciences, he was a good pick.  He could be a little bit more effective with teaching lecture, but I guess that's not his forte. Labs are easy but tests are a different story.  Study for them with examples in the textbook review.","I honestly believe this is the worst professor at Baruch College. He is a nice person but I swear he is talking to himself when he explains things. He speaks about Bio as if he is in a room full of experiences scientists. He does not help in narrowing down the chapters for exams. He doesn't realize we have other classes. AVOID!","I actually liked this class very much.  I believe he was truly the easiest professor for IDC compared to the other 2. Easy papers, ok midterm, and a project. He's also very nice and even though the entire semester was about HIV/AIDS, it was actually very interesting stuff and you learn a lot.  Highly recommend him!","WOW is all I have to say. Took him my last semester, because of the science requirement. Never have I worried so much about a class before. Instead of focusing on BPL and my 2 hour meetings and 20 page paper, I was worried about this stupid bio class. Were in a business school, and mostly seniors in the class....

Don't underestimate the final, it counts for a lot of your grade.","Take orgo with him if you can, it's a very fast paced class, but he has very clear expectations in the class and wants you to do well. 4 tests, final, and 4 quizzes (with the option of being group quizzes for extra credit). He lectures well and makes sheets with only what you need to memorize, do the practice tests and sheets!","Unless you are preparing for the MCAT or genuinely interested in chemistry, take someone else.

Organic Chemistry was a struggle, but Johnson is in all honesty a very fair professor. The key to this class is not falling behind. Hit the ground running, and do the \"recommended\" (pretty much required) homework every single day. Study hard and this class won't be so bad. Tough grader, but does implement a curve.","Great orgo professor and very fair with exams. He is a little awkward but is awesome at lecturing. He is definitely one of the best teachers I have had at Geneseo, not because hes \"easy\", but because he does a great job at teaching his students. Orgo is not an easy class, but Johnson makes it bearable. Practice exams are similar to in class exams.","AWESOME ORGO PROFESSOR. TAKE HIM. Unlike many teachers at this school, he teaches you EVERYTHING he wants you to know so you can use the book as just a supplement to your studying. Take home quizzes and practice tests are similar to the tests in content/format, and all of the tests are completely fair. Not the most personable guy.","Straightforward and helpful, if a little dull. Lab demands a lot of work and self-direction. Attendance at the pre-lab lecture is mandatory. Johnson's pre-lab is incredibly useful, so pay attention. Do all recommended readings and study for the lab final.","hands down the best orgo professor you can take. KEEP UP WITH THE WORK, especially for the third exam (it is considerably more challenging than the others). make sure you understand the quiz before tests (it is take-home) and the practice exams that he posts online. if you can do these, you'll do well on the tests. not impossible to get an A at all","AWESOME professor. Deserves an award. Orgo is supposed to be a very difficult class but he makes it easy to learn, I highly recommend him.","I go to class.  I do the homework right after. The quizzes are take home.

Also.. if you have trouble... go to the tutor Adam.... hes a great deal of help!","Very clear and concise notes and his tests are quite fair. He never puts anything you've never seen before on the exams. He is very shy, but once you get to know him, he is genuinely nice and wants to help you if you have trouble (office hours!) Orgo is naturally tons of work, but if you study hard and keep up with the work, his tests are doable!","absolutley great professor.

She has no power points, just writes on the board. Not much homework, so grade depends on test scores. However, she is very mean. I dropped the class after she threatened half the class with pink slips because we defended a student after he asked for help.","She can sometimes have a tendency to just read her notes and copy paste them onto the board. Very lecture and note taking heavy, so if thats an issue I wouldnt suggest her. However, she is pretty lenient and if you attend class youll know what will be on the test since she gives the questions for the quizzes from the book.","Class is lecture heavy, monotonous and droning. Nzewi encourages students to ask questions but she has a tendency to be condescending if students don't grasp new concepts right away. On a few occasions she has even belittled her students in the front of class for things such as their names or their handwriting.","She can come off as intimidating but you'll soon relax and realize she's invested in her students' success. Maybe 2-3 quick hw assignments (for ENTIRE SEM), a few quizzes with a midterm and final which were multiple choice.

I cannot stress this enough - you will HATE whatever subject he is teaching and LEARN NOTHING, regardless of your interests.","He needs to be fired already!

To make it worse, hes the only one who teach cs270, obviously if there's other teacher no one will ever register for his class.","This old man needs to retire.

Unclear, unprepared and uninformative.  I sympathize with his physical impairments, but they are such that he may simply not be able to teach a class anymore. I wish he would realize that.  Expected us to write programs  but refused to ever show us how during this introductory course.","worst teacher in the world.  Gave me a C because I started to complain that he wasn't able to answer simple questions and thinks the students are his enemies.  Went to the CS dept. and they said there's nothing they can do.  Grades aren't based on anything because he doesn't even grade tests or homework.","I honestly feel sorry for him. I tried taking the 101 course (ended subing another for the requirement) and felt like I was teaching more than him.","It's so true, it really is. Mr Baptiste is way past his prime and probably should go ahead and retire. He needs students to help him unlock the classroom, prepare the equipment, and even recite the lectures!

Buy yourself a book on SQL and save yourself the headache of taking her class.","If you have any questions, be prepared to wait at least 3-4 hours for a response. Assignments are hard because you won't understand how to do it unless you ask her and IF you're lucky, she might give you a hint that actually helps. Does not post correct answers either so you can't even learn from your mistakes. DO NOT TAKE UNLESS YOU WANT TO FAIL.","SQL is useful for people in tech but Notes and assignment is most of the time confuse you! (They actually both are great but you can not find anything that might help you solve problem) Personally I think teacher is ok and motivate you to study compare to another online classes! Good luck! ","The worse part for me was reading her class notes. They are long (2,118,930 words - to put that in perspective, the novel War and Peace has 587,287 words.) Unlike a great novel, the notes are loaded with typos and poor grammar. Grading is arbitrary. I DID learn MySQL but I will never take one of her classes again. You will not get an A (impossible)","If real FLUENCY in SQL at a low price, Ruth Endres's DB courses are for you! The rigorous exercises she has compiled mimic problems you'll face later in the real world. If you're worried about your GPA, take this course pass/fail. But if being a master of data matters to you, TAKE THIS COURSE. The world really needs more people with SQL knowledge.","She is inflexible. This course is lots of work for the beginners of the subject and she doesn't offer the correct solutions! She only provides us with the explanation of the solutions. Thus if you work full time and if you are taking 4 other classes! It is nearly impossible to catch up and learn from her class.","Her notes barely explains anything. I took her class, and I didn't like it all. Her notes wasn't concise enough. She needs to be more concise or elaborate.","Although I thought the documents she provided explained the material well enough, I thought her grading scheme is harsh. As others have pointed out, finding necessary information is hard. Not too mention, she's very inflexible. You'll learn a lot in this class though if you put the effort, although I'd say it's near impossible to get an A.","This online class was really poorly designed and administered.  It's darn near impossible to trace assignment grades/ comments to understand errors due to format. Assignments were often vague which caused confusion.  Rose was not flexible and i can't really recommend this class due to both the instructor and format.","Rose is a wonderful teacher. She will take time out of her schedule to help you if you are lost. The negative reviews on here are all by people who simply didn't ask for help when they needed it. She teaches SQL, and learning SQL online is like taking an online course for latin where all the instructions are in latin. it's going to be hard.","She has one of the worst online courses ever offered. Her expectations are so vague and the information you need so scattered that it makes it impossible to stay sane. For my class when it was brought to her attention that students new to the subject were completely lost she actually posted a READ ME explaining that it was our fault for not trying.","Disorganized, doesn't teach from book, regularly has typos in notes,confusing word/sentence structure in notes. No examples of expected homework style after the fact, covers topics the book never mentions. Hard to tell if you're learning as 90% of the homework is a rehash of an example from notes.","Not a good choice for online classes at all. For SQL, she assigns HW each week but does not provide an answer key after grading your assignment. She will not actually show you the code she wants; she will just mark you wrong. She expects you to figure it out yourself, but that isn't possible if you're new to the subject. This is hardly teaching.","great teacher. the materials she provided were better than any of her textbooks. you can learned a lot from just study her materials alone. the grade system is fair, however i think she take off points too deep, sometimes. but i love her assignments, it always challenges you mind and let you learn alot.","Class organization is very good, but for me it turned out to be little tougher than what I expected for CCSF. This is  programming class, so may be it's appropriate to be that way. No easy grades here for sure.","Very nice teacher, but I wish her talk little louder.

No multiple-choice tests/hws. Weekly homework consists of answering 3-4 questions with a bunch of sub-questions. By the time you finish, you wrote a 3-4 page paper. Harsh grader with generic copy/paste feedback. Very hard to get an A.","Easiest A of my life. However, I was very interested in the subject and got very little out of the class. All work is basically a copy and paste from her online presentations. Feedback is horrible on assignments, she just copy and pastes a general recommendation.

You can tell he is very knowledgeable when it comes to documentary making, and he actively tries to make his class worthwhile (and it is)! He's the kind of professor with whom  you can have an actual conversation and not feel spoken down to. ","He's one of the better SMAD professors I have taken at JMU. He's a wonderful and inspiring guy who definitely knows his stuff about the film industry. He makes it easy to approach him and ask for help and feedback on work. I would definitely recommend","I just took Professor O'Connor's midterm. I study quite a bit and the test was very specific and difficult. Ive attended each and every class and he always manages to make me almost fall asleep. He is a good guy, knows his stuff, but is not a very skilled professor. Tends to ramble on and lose his audience very easily. ","Professor O'Connor is a strange one. Is he really interesting person and carries the \"movie-making\"vibe, but as a person he is pretty disorganized. Shouldn't really be an advisor but I don't think he has a choice.  Very unclear about what he wants from you. You  will only have to write one screenplay so no homework. Fun class!","You don't need to read the book.  Only take lecture notes when you're going over something you'll have to write about later. Just listen and absorb.  He likes to talk, but if you have something smart to say he'll appreciate it.  He's not the best teacher, but I can't help liking him anyway.","The above reviewer of Prof. O'Connor's 398 class seems confused. Professor O'Connor administered this class in Los Angeles. He didn't teach it. He brought in guest speakers from film industry. Therefore I don't know how he can be rated on his teaching. By the way, the program he launched and administered was terrific.","Baddd teacher. Class was pointless. He split us into groups which we had for the rest of the semester. We would pitch ideas off of each other and evaluate each others works but that only took 10 minutes so the rest of the class we were just goofing around. It was a fun class and he doesn't keep up with his attendance policy. Pointless lectures.","O'Connor's screenwriting class is cool. You write your own screenplays and cast other students to read the characters. It's a little scary. But O'Connor keeps it on point. Having a blast. O'Connor is a writer and understands. Good guy. The book's OK. Take him.","Excellent professor. He's in the business, working major filmmakers. I took him for screenplay writing and was blown away. He creates and positive supportive and professional atmosphere in his workshops.","He was a genuinely nice and sincere guy which is way i felt so guilty for not liking him as a professor. I was rooting for him to, just one, give a halfway decent lecture, but the bottom line was that he just had a lot of rambling that led nowhere and i just really didn't learn anything","Going to class was pointless - he babbled on about nothing significant, repeated himself endlessly, and generally wasted valuable time.  Read books and watched movies - didn't do any writing (other than a paper at the end).  He's a talented man, that's for sure, but an awful teacher.","O'Connor did a great job showing how to format and write scripts for tv ads, radio news, psa's, documentaries, and film.  He's got some serious credentials (a few emmy's) so he knows what he's talkin about.  Sometimes he takes questions that students ask kind of personally, made it hard to get answers out of him sometimes, but other than that great","Took Thomas O'Connor for screenplay writing. Wow!

Class drags a little bit.","Talked too much at the beginning of the semester when we should have been working on screenwriting exercises and reading screenplays.  Not good not bad.  Just very plain.","I enjoyed O'Connor's class overall when I took it back in the early nineties.  I did think that he was a little biased towards certain styles of writing and certain writers.  I respect him for his emmy, but an emmy alone doesn't qualify one for teaching.","He knows about the process of film adaptations, but he doesn't seem to know much about the novels you read in class.

One of the most important things to him , is that you believe in yourself!! I owe my college education to this man. ","TC change hwo I thought about school.  He was the toughest teacher I ever had, but teh smartest.  If he was hard on you it was because he knew you could do it.  Those who hate, couldn't hang!  I miss you TC!","I waited until my senior year last semester to take TC. What a shame I wish I would have sooner. 11 yrs later I swear I still think and read the way he trained us. Take him now. You will appreciate the insight you gain.","He's Jesuit trained...and it shows. Timid students find him intimidating. But if you want to learn, he'll get you there, even if that means he has to tech you to read. I mean really \"read\". Did you know Oedipus did not kill daddy and marry mommy? You will after TC teaches you how to read. The most awe-inspiring professor I ever studied with.","Rant - I'm shocked that TC is getting such a low score.. He was the toughest professor I ever had: hardest A- I ever earned. He challenged us to THINK critically. Using ancient Greek methods, he pushed our brains in new directions. The only people I've talked to who didn't like TC were lazy-minded. He was helpful to those who WORKED hard. He did not tolerate half-assing *anything*. If you're into coasting through college on your fat, lazy ass - you wouldn't like his style.","I may have not been the best student in the class, but he would ridicule you in front of the whole class if you got an answer wrong.

Whenever you would ask him questions his explanations were not always clear or he would just respond with another question. Just going to lectures is not enough, you need to read the textbook if you want to do well in the class. Very weirdly worded and formatted exams. Curve was good.","His lectures were helpful but I recommend reading the book before lecture. He interacts with the front rows so just be mindful of that. His tests weren't horrible but did require a lot of review- so read the book, redo homework and discussion problems and go to TA office hours. TA discussion sessions helped SO much make the most out of it.","Only reason I passed with a B was because of LARC & constant studying w friends. He's better off doing research, Not understanding at all, expects you to be people who know chem terms beforehand. He's a genius himself but when you ask for clarification, he's quite condescending. 1 of the TAs were like that too when my exam p table was printed weird","He makes this class very fun & interesting and he's very passionate & respectable. His lectures are very straightforward and he is always available if you need extra help. Attendance isn't mandatory but his lectures are very useful. His midterms are as difficult as you would expect for a Chemistry class but he curves well and is very understanding.","His first time teaching this course in AGES. He is more of a research professor and assumes we should know chem lingo when this is an introductory course. The midterms are fair, but doesnt give out practice tests. YOU WILL NOT SURVIVE ON LECTURE ALONE, GO TO DISCUSSIONS. He is a bit all over the place and doesnt explain things well.","His tests are extrememly difficult, no kidd half my class had depressed looks on their faces coming out of the final, the average was 101/250, and the st. dev was 40, study hard, for this class, pay attention to the things he says that arent in the book, the little things, and his wierd questions he puts up, book probs are way more helpful than dis","This professor is EXTREMELY easy and straightforward. I have no idea why everybody is complaining about him? Midterms were straight from Wiley, worksheets, and practice exams. Final was hard, but he gave us 50 pts EC and curve was low. TA were helpful. Just read the book, do wiley problems, worksheets, practice exams and you will be more than fine.","I was surprised that a lot of people disliked him. I've had a MUCH worse Chem prof at UCI. Apkarian is quirky, eccentric, and yes, looks like Einstein. I'm not that great in Chem to begin with and I did very well. People were seriously just either lazy or clueless in this class. Exams were fair and the TAs were very good.","lectures are terribly done and hard to follow. i would say read the book to learn the info but his exams are so hard knowing the material doesn't help. exams are multiple choice so no partial credit can be given and since he has less than 10 q's per exam, people did terribly. and yet he was surprised/disappointed in our 36% average.","He's kinda fun and weird and I tend to like professors like that. But his lectures are confusing and his exams are super hard. Even if you study your ass off, there's bound to be some totally random questions that haven't been covered. And he seems to love using uncommon units, which screw me over in tests so many times.","he looks like albert einstein!!","Avoid at all costs. He's a bad teacher, which makes everyone do terribly on his tests. One of the midterm's mean was 36/100 for the class. I don't know what happened to him. He got pretty good reviews before...","He shows enthusiasm for the subject, which I like, but his tests are ridiculous!  The last midterm was 6 questions: 5 multiple choice and 1 free response.  These 6 questions total up to 100 points--meaning questions were over 10 points each.  So basically if you missed ONE multiple choice question, your score dropped at least ONE FULL letter grade","This professor is one of the hardest i had for gchem. His tests are extremely hard and even if you study for the tests for a couple of days, you still wont be able to do good. This professor is not helpful in telling us how the tests are like and almost nothing from the book comes from the lectures.","I don't know why people are saying he's good. This is all he does in lectures: give us a formula, show us the easiest example possible, and give us questions on exams that are 20 times harder than what we know. If you study, you'll probably still won't do well unless you're really good at chem in the first place...","His lecture is very interesting but his note sucks!! Good professor.  You can do well in the class if you read the book and do the hw.  No need to go to class~","His lecture is kinda interesting but his note is confusing!","I thought this professor was very hard! The class was full of students who passed AP Chem in High School so they obviously knew their stuff, so that was an advantage. He taught way too advanced.

I never opened the book once and easily got an A, just by taking good detailed notes and studying those.  The tests are all essays, but you have a choice, plus everyone is assigned a book to read and review.  If you aren't good at just lecture classes, probably not for you.","It is clear that Dr. Lucas knows the material. That being said, he is not the most engaging lecturer as he will primarily read from his notes. The tests are all essay and you need to be specific in order to receive full credit. Dr. Lucas is more than happy to help you if you ask. Brush up on elections for his US history courses.","Come one come all! Watch the \"Iron man of education,\" M.B.

This professor is the worst I've ever had. EVER. Purposefully fails students. 2 or 3 people got greater than C.","Very nice person, seems strict but you will see that he is a little more lenient. He definitely cares about his students so don't hesitate to ask for his help! Exams are essay based, usually 3 per exam. Study your notes more than the book!","This was not an easy class by any means. He gives random pop quizzes every week over the reading. His lectures are oral and he tends to get off subject quite often. His exams are over the class lectures and he rarely gives any kind of review so make sure you take good notes!","He expects his students to know the material.  Yes, all of his exams are essay based, but during lectures he is sure to tell you the details of what will be on the exams. Reading the book when assigned is important if you want to do well on the pop quizes, but by reading the book you also have a better understanding of European history. Take it!","He is very hard. But don't hesitate to talk to him if you need help. He really does care about his students and if you just ask questions and talk to him let him know what is going on he will do his best to help you. I was certain I was either to make a C or D in the class but when the final grades were posted to my surprise I received a B.","M.B.Lucas is a fun guy. He likes to make jokes and tell stories everyday. He likes to throw pop quizzes once a week over the textbook readings but if you do those, you should be fine. The exams are all essays but if you take good note in class and know them, you can do really well.","Extreme workloads and ridiculous expectations. This teacher purposely fails students.","He is such a sweet fellow, and like to crack jokes all the time, very dry jokes at that. However, he is very big on lists (3 reasons why...) or (5 causes of...) and although I like him, unless your mind is a steel trap for remembering things, you will struggle with the essay tests and random pop quizzes.","Professor Lucas is an excellent teacher; he genuinely cares about his students and is willing to help in any way possible. For instance, the day of the final I wasn't feeling well and he allowed me to take the final two days later to give me extra time to study! As long as you stay focused and do the assignments you'll do well in this class.","In reading the other reviews, I agree; Lucas is a difficult teacher.  However, he is helpful in catching you up if you need it.  Lucas comes across as a hard-@ss, but he's really not.  He's a big softie when you get to know him.  Just let him know what's going on with your life and he'll help you the best way he can.  Give him a chance.","Professor Lucas is a nice guy but this class is insane! I stayed up all night studying for the final and I don't think I did good at all. There's a crap-load of notes and the tests are straight essays.

This course is very easy to pass, as there is 50% in quizzes, 8% of optional homework (5 tries/question), and 10% in labs (100% if you show up).

His lectures are quick and concise. He could use some updated notes but regardless they are good enough for the course. He is also a funny guy. \"Teach this to your family cat\" and \"It ain't rocket science folks\" are his catchphrases. If u study 3 hours a week max u will get an easy A+","Very condescending. Not helpful at all when you email him. I was told to learn how to read when I was confused about the wording on an assignment because \"engineers are required to do so\". Avoid. Avoid. Avoid. Its not rocket science.","stay away if possible, he sends 50 emails instead of using D2L and wonders why there's so much confusion. He thinks teaching the course by pointing at a screen with his notes from 2002 is good enough. Doesn't know how to use an iclicker but could probably code one. \"teach this to the family cat\" \"Its not rocket science folks\" \"thx\" \"cheers\"","I just want to say if you don't know programming Don't go to his class. He always acts as he cares about the student but he does not. Terrible lectures, terrible teaching. I went to all of his class due to icliker but I wish I didn't cause he just wastes my time. he respects to a student but when it comes to teaching is awful.","Dr. Panar is very condescending. If you don't understand, he will tell you \"It's not rocket science\" or he will not help you if you missed class, even if for a good reason. He also teaches only by example problems, not by actual concepts. If you have no background in computer programming, you should switch to another prof.","I took CPS118 thinking that it would be a bird course. IT IS NOT. It was my lowest mark this semester. You really need to memorize matlab commands for the practical tests and the final exam. Getting a good mark is doable, but you'll need to put in the work which is annoying for a course like this.","All I've learned about this class is that its not rocket science.","Teacher is nice and very knowledgeable of the subject, but when it comes to teaching techniques he's lacking. Also he goes really slow on simple topics, then when the tough ones come near the end he goes quick. I understand that this a intro course to programming, but if you believe you know basics, best to just go over power points by yourself.","Extremely knowledgable about the material. Explains programs and concepts during lecture in some detail. Doesn't give breaks. Approachable during and office hours and after class for help, although somewhat condescending. For beginners to programming, his lectures may be hard to follow or understand, so go to other profs if you can. Decent overall.","\"It ain't rocket science folks!\" Although respected and willing to help out students, he need to change his teaching techniques. Simply lecturing or speaking out the code doesn't really help the students, especially ones who are taking coding for the first time. More complete, neat code would help students better to understand, and how to program.","He was okay. The class itself was really easy and the content was, too. He was knowledgeable about all of the material, but sometimes he came off as a bit condescending. I probably wouldnt have done very well if the class wasnt a complete joke. Other than that, he gives great life advice!","\"its not rocket science folks\" you will hear that all semester if you can bring yourself to show up to his class. Slides are horrible and useless but the midterm and exam weren't that bad so its possible to get a good grade.","Panar is a great prof, however it it important you show up to leture. 1/2 way through the semester many people were missing, and thats a no no. Panar posts ntes online, and is easy to acesss outside of class for help. I reccomend him","In-class notes were highly disorganized. Joshua Panar has supposedly taught the course for an extended period of time but still finds errors in his own notes, a blow to his credibility as a professor. He does not know for sure if some of the curriculum is correct but insists that \"it is not rocket science,\" his trademark phrase.","Dr. Panar's teaching skills are some of the worst I have ever witnessed. He barely has knowledge of the actual course material, yet he tells you it's not \"rocket science\" at least ten times a class. His lectures are literally him reading a very disorganized powerpoint.

He respects his students and I give him that. However, he is very set in his ways. I told him I have horrible test anxiety and tests make up most of the grades. He gave extra credit but it didn't help much. He also didn't seem to care that my grandpa (a psychologist himself) was hospitalized which impacted my work. ","Riley is one of the best professors at American University and by far the best lecturer I have ever seen. He knowledge is endless, and his slides/explanations are flawless. All the reviews on this are likely Freshman who didn't study the normal amount for a technical stem course. Take Neuro-psychopharmacology and it will change your life.","Overall my favorite professor at AU. His classes are tough but its because he genuinely wants you to know the material. He cares about his students and wants them to do the best they possibly can but wont give out easy As. Hes funny, quirky and an extremely intelligent lecturer with years of experience and storys to go along with it.","The self-proclaimed \"crazy old man\", Prof Riley, or Tony, is a quirky, foulmouthed guy but is clearly very smart about psych. Make sure you take good notes during lecture and work with classmates to construct a study guide for the tests. You basically have to re-answer what was said in the lecture so as long as you prepare for that you'll do fine.","PSYC 240 is a hard topic and course. Riley is engaging and enthusiastic about the topic. He is a tough-tough grader. Exams are worth 60% of the course. Study with a buddy. Do not miss deadlines (not accommodating). Do quizzes. Be prepared to \"fail.\"","Has extremely high standards of students and begins the semester showing off awful reviews like prizes. I really dont recommend him for non-psyc majors. You can attend class, review sessions, and study for HOURS and still not manage to get a decent grade. Has to give tons of extra credit to compensate for it.","Riley is a really good and engaging lecturer, but PSYCH 115 is a difficult class. Your grade is entirely based on four difficult exams. The class is fun and I feel like I learned a lot, but I was hoping for a higher grade. You have to do the readings to succeed on the tests, but they're interesting and narrative based.","There are four test total in this class. You have to read one book for each exam. He is really funny in class. I wouldn't recommend for a gen ed class.","You need to go to the lectures to take notes bc the powerpoints don't make sense without his lecture. Adds a ton of useless info to powerpoints and makes you stress a lot more about exams than you should. 4 exams all open ended short answer. Doesn't give study guides. Gives lots of extra credit. Knows his stuff and helps during office hours.","Riley is an animated lecturer, who's obviously very knowledgable. The problem is he has extremely high expectations for a level 100 gen ed. If you are not a psych major, don't torment yourself with this course.","Very knowledgeable and passionate about lectures, but gives 4 tests that are all open ended that ask both broad questions and specifics. if you want to do well on the tests you must devote a significant amount of time to studying. however, to make up for the tests he offers a ton of extra credit that can boost you a full letter grade.","One of the best professors in AU. Teaches with a lot of passion and is very engaging. I learned a lot in his class.","Professor Riley is very interesting and a hilarious professor. However, his class is difficult and requires a lot of attention and note taking. If you like psychology and are willing to put in the time, you'll do well. May not be the best choice for an easy gen ed","What is the point of a class if you are having a mental breakdown every time you have an exam? 10 pages of multi paragraph short answer question for each exam. I never hated college until I took his class.","Honestly, for a Gen Ed he was insane. I didn't get much out of the class at all, what I studied for wasn't even on his exams. The entire class is just four exams. You better be a good test taker in order to pass. He is very off topic, isn't super helpful, and if you don't have his books he asks you to read, good luck.","just don't do it. It unreasonable difficult and the workload is insane. six books for 14 weeks of school??","Drop this class RIGHT NOW if you aren't a psychology major. I'm a CAS student with a job + own business on the side of school. Unless you have the passion/countless hours to read, study, and MEMORIZE the LOADS of useless (but interesting) information he piles on you, you will FAIL. NO multiple choice on exams and tests on like 9 books/semester.","I feel like if you don't like Riley, its probably because psychology isn't interesting to you. Aside from a huge amount of reading, theres relatively little work and its clear what is expected on the tests. Hes generally pretty laid back and he has a weird sense of humor but overall pretty good.","The lectures are terribly boring and hard to understand. I don't know how he can make a class that could have been so interesting this awful. Honestly, take bio of something.","The absolute Worst! Taking this for FA5? DON'T! RUN AWAY FROM HIM AND HIS TAs!

Her exam was traumatic though, you need to know every minute detail of everything she says. Course cram got me a good mark on Bio102, so i did it again for Bio103 and barely passed... take so, so many notes if you're in her class. if you skip, you won't pass.","She makes the lectures captivating, she says a lot so best if you write lecture notes or print out slides before so you can just add on. The 3 term quizzes are not bad and the midterm, on the other hand, was too hard. Best way to study for the final is to re watch all lecture videos and take notes as details are in the final. Overall great prof.","Go to all her lectures or you will not do well in this course, and make sure you know all of the dumb things she talks about (like shark steaks), because she asks lots of hypothetical questions. Before the final I watched all of her lecture videos to study and made notes off of that, this took a long time, but definitely paid off in the end.","Virginia is an amazing prof but she is quite the character. Her lectures are very interesting and engaging; however, make sure you write down EVERYTHING that she says (shark soup). Don't memorize the textbook or go to course cram, it will not help at all for the exam. The best you can do is re-watch her lecture videos and study off of those notes.","Very engaging lectures but her test and exam questions are on the most specific details that she only mentioned once. Do the readings she mentions in the textbook because although she will never mention them again, they are likely to show up on a test or the exam.","Wow! Her lectures are packed full of information, but they are engaging. She is clearly passionate about what she lectures on.  The exam was difficult, but a good grade is definitely attainable with some hard work. Overall, great prof and would definitely take another course from her.","She wasn't too bad to listen too, although I didn't attend many of her early morning lectures. She seemed very willing to give help and have plenty of office hours available. She does make you work for your marks, doing homework, readings and attending lectures is a good choice if you want to do well on her tests and exams.","Okay here's the thing, Virginia Walker is one of the best profs I had in first year. She made the 8:30 lectures easy to stay focused in and very interesting and funny. With that being said, her exam is brutal. Focus on every small little detail and story she tells if you want to pass her section.","I enjoyed the material;  the way Dr. Walker presents is effective (in terms of keeping you engaged). However, every upper year I talked to warned me of the final's brutality. To no surprise, it was the hardest exam ever. HOWEVER, the grade distribution was good. When studying, connect everything to everything, and ask what if questions. Don't fret!","She is an amazing lecturer, and it was hard to NOT pay attention! She has high expectations, and teaches a lot of material. Her exams are designed to test knowledge and understanding, as opposed to memorization. Re-watch lecture videos on 2x speed a few weeks before the exam, take detailed notes throughout the semester, and you'll do well.","Best teacher you can expect.","May have actually just failed her exam. Please listen to people when they say her exam is brutal. It is brutal. I have nothing else to say.","Literally the worst prof ever. Once you see her exams, you will realized that the only reason she teaches is to fail students. She tries to make lectures funny but you can't enjoy them because you have to take note of every single detail she says even if she says it for once.","Gives excellent explanations of processes. I have referred back to my notes taken in this course for Physiology in second year because she makes it so clear and yet still thorough. She also makes herself available after class to go through things if you don't understand. Exam was really hard though--mostly application questions.","Dr. Walker tests in a different manner than every other first year prof. Her exams are all application questions, so you need to be able to apply, *not just regurgitate* all the facts! She is very funny, animated & clear. She makes time after every lecture for questions. All lectures are videotaped. Great prof, if you work hard you'll be fine. ","On one hand, you want to like Walker because she is very animated and her lectures are interesting. On the other hand, you need to remember a lot of little details. If she even mentions something in passing, it will most likely be on the exam. Lectures can be hard to follow. I would recommend re-watching lectures online during reading week","Worst prof I've ever had. She doesn't teach ANYTHING she tests. The exam might as well have been in a different language. I have no idea how she is still allowed to give us those exams!!!!","Makes lectures fun, but tests on every little detail she says in class, especially side stories! Exam questions are almost unfair.","I loved  her lectures always very entertaining and fairly easy to follow and she is always eager to help you out after class!

(over 3 weeks for 2nd exam) The book is useful for easier probs. but not for his kind of probs. 36 students in the beginning, 10 students by the end He does have old tests and quizzes online with answers.","Very nice guy, and no doubt a great mathematician, but doesn't really teach you anything. Gives you a lot of papers he wrote about his theories and then leaves you to teach yourself with the book. Lectures consist of him answering questions, and scribbling wildly on the board. You have to do the learning on your own.","Provides previous tests to reveiw prior to testing, but on occasions they did not actually review the information needed.Seems tired of his profession as its more of a burden now. Took extremely long returning grades(over 3 weeks for 1 exam)I recommend avoiding if you have the option. About 30 students beginning the semester and about 8 at the end.","Gives you previous tests to study with-very helpful.  He is very fast paced but if you stick to his previous tests and quizzes you'll do fine.","Very nice man.  He is extremely smart and truly cares about his students.  Yes, you must do a lot of self learning and form study groups.  However, he GIVES you all his past tests and quizzes WITH answers... If you study those you should do fine.  I like that style because I know EXACTLY what to expect.  I would recommend if you are decent at math.","Always thought I failed a test or quiz after I'm done taking it. But grades do not turn out to be horrible. Be sure to go over past quizzes and test found on blackboard try to solve all of them cause similar questions show up","Ok prof. You have to learn to teach yourself. In order to pass  This class u must study reviews, and work each question out before any quiz or test.

Why is he even teaching is what I find myself asking majority of the class. old and senile and should have retired A LONG time ago","Very nice man, good intentions overall and he wants you to do well. In the end you basically have to teach yourself throughout the whole course, my advice is to form a study group and go over the material as much as you can to grasp it well enough to do good on the quizzes of tests.","Worst professor I have ever had. If you typically make A's in math and algebra, expect to make a C. He will tell you that he has his own way of teaching math. So forget everything you have learned to this point, because it will only confuse you!!The Math Tutors in the learning lab have no idea what he is trying to teach. DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASSES!!","In all honesty one of the worst professors I have had thus far. I generally like math on a basic level and even though it doesn't always come easy to me I still manage... NOT in this class!!! His lectures are unorganized, he doesn't teach from the book yet that is where all your work and reviews come from...stay clear away from his class...","If math does not come to you easily or you dislike it, do not take this class. It is self taught. He tries to teach you his \"easy\" way, ways that aren't in the textbook. but it makes everything more complicated. His methods work, but only when you understand what you're doing. It is not in the textbook for a reason: this is a basic algebra class.","If you are someone who doesn't \"get\" Algebra easily, this is not the teacher for you. He's a very nice man, and clearly very caring about his students. He is willing to help, but doesn't explain things very clearly. Be prepared to spend lots of time in the learning lab!","His teaching style is a little different. He wants you to review the material, then come to class with any questions. He calls it, \"Pre-Work.\" If you follow it closely, it works out pretty good. He is always helpful, and willing to stay late to help. He's extremely intelligent so you may have to ask for an easier way to solve a problem. Good Prof.","Nice man. Unorganized and gets off on Tangents. Assigns homework very class. It doesnt help since he does not teach the same way the book does. If you take this teacher expect to spend a lot of time in the learning lab.

Pierce will test you on things that he randomly points out in class, that are not memorable or even related to social psychology. Midterms are hard, final is cumulative. Sometimes Pierce is kind of funny, but generally a difficult and boring class.","Lectures are extremely dry trivia without guidance from prof to build narrative or connect dots, no emphasis on any one point. Exams are bizarrely difficult. Extremely poor quality class, very disappointed. Didn't do anything wrong technically so I can't even appeal my grade or complain. He shouldn't lecture if he's as indifferent to it as he acts.","Knowing your stuff isn't enough in this class, you need to do insane online tests with the awful textbook that don't relate to what he actually tests on.

Ridiculous overall.","I can't believe I paid money for this course. I wanted to learn social psychology, not what Pierce thinks of this and that.

I've done the worst in this out of all of my courses in my whole two prior years.","Everyone is exactly correct. He's a nice man but holy cow his lectures are dry, confusing, conflict with the textbook, and are difficult to get the point of.

I do not recommend!!!","Had this prof a bit ago for stats. Flew through slides with few examples and expected you to connect the dots for the math. Passed, only because I sat in on a different stats class and got math tutoring. His class was a waste and overly difficult for what it was.","More slides in one lecture than my 3 hour night class (that covers 2/3 topics in one class)!

Doc is one of the most interesting people at the university, but he is more inclined to teach the engineer than the physicist, as there are so many more in the class.

This is college people and his class (SPT 330) is a WRITING INTENSIVE class!!!!  Suck it up, do the work, see him a few times during office hours and take good notes; then the class will be a great beneficiary towards post grad life.","the hardest professor and class in the LSS major. grades very difficult. lots and lots of time needs to be devoted to this class and you still will get points off. he doesn't explain assignments well and he takes points off for things that you were never told about. definitely do not copy anyone's work in class, because you will receive a zero.","He seems nice in class but If you need assistance he'll expect the worst of you. He can be quite unreasonable and a bit of a grinch.","Online course, expects students to exercise 5/6 times a week for an A. Almost impossible to do if you have a summer job. Even if you do meet requirements for A,throws random test at you that u must research on google.If you get that 3/5 you get B no matter what. waste of my time! doesn't respond to email in timely manner or at all.","I Missed two classes the entire semester. I sent him an email both times i missed class. He took off thirty percentage points of my final grade due solely to missing the two classes (from an A to a C). But he canceled class twice with no consequence to himself.  He taught nothing the entire semester. Responds to emails with maybe 5 words. NO GOOD.","Extremely dry teacher in an already boring class. Seemed to be nice, but he would sometimes get facts wrong. Not a bad prof, but not a good prof either. Read the book for tests, cause they're harder than you would think.","This man was the most unhelpful and rude prof I've ever had.  Not only does he expect a student who is taking an online class to be at the gym 5-6 times/week for an \"A\", but if you ask him questions, he responds with one word or doesn't reply at all. Just take a class that you actually go to, you're better off and avoid this man if at all possible.","Had him for an online gym course and he was completely unhelpful and came across as rude in his emails. Actually sent me emails consisting of meaningless one-word answers to my questions. I did everything that he asked of us but still only got a B in his class. Just seemed like he didn't care at all. Avoid if possible.","I had him for an online winter course, so I did not met him face to face, but it seems my impression of him was right from reading other reviews. He comes across as rude and unhelpful. Every email I have sent he has not bothered replying to, and he wants us to complete a quiz with a TWO HOUR timeframe. How fair is that for people who have to work??","I knew every single answer when being quized before his tests and never got higher than a C on them. He doesnt word his tests well at all. I think he is a little rude by the way he calls out kids in a lecture hall who dont know the answer and when i emailed him, he never gave me that great of a response and was rude then as well.

Get to know him - he's got some pretty awesome stories...especially about Guffy!","Mr O'Herron is too lazy to write up new tests. So, you never know how to learn from your mistakes because he doesn't give them back. He won't even let you take notes on your mistakes. He's a spaz.

He is also of no help and does not care if you fail.","Yeah, his teaching style is tough, but memorization is useful.  I have found that I have retained A LOT from his classes when discussing Catholicism with non-Catholics.

However, he is really nice and always willing to help. An interesting aspect of this class is the field trip to Mount Vernon. Besides attending, you are also required to write a paper.","Really nice guy who covers a lot of content. He puts an online on the overhead then talks for the entire class so for exams it's difficult to determine what was important. I suggest taking notes in class and from the textbook. You also need to read the two assigned books for the quizzes; they're easy if you read.","He's a really nice guy. The lectures last all class. He covers a lot of content, so you have to take good notes. If you study before tests, you should be fine. Also, there will be book quizzes, so make sure you read the books.","Professor McCord is incredibly knowledgeable about American history. For someone who is a history major, I really enjoyed his class. It could be really boring for those who aren't interested in history. If you don't read the books you will fail the quizzes. The tests are tough if you do not study at all, and attendance is mandatory for doing well. ","History exposed by a real expert,  in a nice low tech  fascinating story telling mode. Always with interesting sidelights and factoids about the events, places and people; yet tied into the main theme of the development of our nation. History text is good, but no need to buy the latest edition; get the previous one off eBay for much less cost. ","It's obvious by his extensive lectures in class  that Dr. McCord is passionate about history and is very knowledgeable about early American History.  His lectures are long; expect to take LOTS of notes if you want to get a good grade.  If you like history you will find his lectures very interesting: like sitting around a campfire back in the day!","Professor McCord definitely loves history, and it was evident in the lectures, however I felt lost from time and time again. The handouts and papers we had to do were confusing, and I thought I'd lose my mind. Speaking to the professor helps somewhat, but you're on your own for the most part.","Lectures were long and the tests were fairly hard because he asked about obscure people and events so when studying don't focus too much on the big stuff. Only gives three exams and two quizzes. Read the biographies for the quizzes or you won't pass them. Attendance is a biggie for him. Only covered half the syllabus which was disappointing. ","Decent teacher. He has projector slides of an outline you have to copy down verbatim and he just reads them out loud. So so so boring and dry. He goes so slowly and we only got through 3/4 of the material. The book quizzes are easy (if you read) and the midterm and final are take home and relatively OK.","One of the best history professors I've had, has a lot of passion for his subject.","class is pretty straight forward notes on board copy down outline and what he says. Tests based on lectures in class only. Reading quizzes easy. Test can be tricky if you don't memorize everything on notes. Don't bother buying the main textbook only buy the two chapter books","Each class consisted of an hour and half lecture based off of an outline you have to copy down verbatim off of a projector. Then there was four novels we had to read, each one accompanied by a quiz with ambiguous questions. So even if you read the book you won't get an A as the answers are debatable.

I got an A in 122 and I also took his Virginia History class later (B+) because 122 wasn't awful but he was the one professor that stressed me out and it was usually for no reasons his books are lengthy and dry.

It is difficult to get a straight answer from him and he didn't give a concrete outline for the exam or midterm.

He is stuck in the time of Faulkner, Salinger, and Hemingway and refuses to update. No other writing styles allowed.","Hawkes cares about English and seeing improvement in his students. However, his class was the hardest thing I've ever taken. He teaches through intimidation, which I hated. Going to his office hours did not help. Even one on one, he was arrogant and not easy to talk to about how I can improve my writing. Very happy that credit is out of the way.","Hawkes really does want each student to learn and succeed, but he teaches through intimidation and fear, which I did not like. This class was like nothing I've ever experienced, and is THE most difficult class I've ever taken. He is not afraid to get mad and call you out for your mistakes in front of everyone. I dreaded going to class most days.","Hawkes is a really tough professor. If you do everything he says and take his advice you should pass, but unless you can go above and beyond and write like Orwell, you're not going to get an A.","Hawkes is tough. He'll make you question yourself as a writer. However, if you are serious about writing he will prepare you for the real world. His edits are fantastic and he is incredibly helpful. I saw a tremendous improvement in the quality of my writing while I was in his classes.","Hawkes is one of the most intimidating people you will ever meet, but he is also one of the most willing to help.  He is a character builder, and as a writer, character is very important. He has made me a more organized and thoughtful writer and reader, and I thank him.","He is tough and merciless, but underneath he really cares about your success as a writer. He may seem cruel and purposefully mean, but he wants to test and challenge you. He needs you to know that writing is what you really want to do. He will be the best thing to happen to you in the writing program. I am in a MFA program now because of him.","Definitely one of the hardest teachers I've ever had. Very strict, but he's overall a really good prof. He does have the tendency to tell people off in front of the class, which can be humiliating. He's hard to take at times, but in the end you'll be glad to have taken his class.","He is the rudest, most arrogant jerk. I know writing is supposed to be tough but he was an ***hole. Supposedly intermediate level, felt like graduate level. Forget creativity or new ideas. Graded stories on his personal interest in them, not on the writing itself. Not worth the personal insults to my face in front of every class. Changing my major.","Definitely the best English teacher I've ever had, although he's much better in creative writing classes than general English.  He is terrifying but awesome.","The problem for Dr Hawkes is and has been twofold: That he is an over-qualified teacher in a four year par school so he comes across as hard on the kiddies, when he should instead be beating up on graduates; and that he rejected his own crossroads, he should be writing instead and he knows it.","I hated him when I took intro to creative writing, and thought the feeling was mutual. He's an excellent teacher though,  you just have to be able to take criticism. Students who can't take it are the ones who drop it after a day or two. He thickened my skin and prepared me for publication and graduate school for a MFA in Creative Writing. Best.","Had him for about a week for English 107. he ignored my input during class discussions when I had already read and written papers on the assigned readings being discussed when I was in 11th grade. He didn't listen to what everyone had to say. if you have taken ap lang & comp test & got a 4 or higher  dont take this class...its the same thing.","He tried to tell us Sylvia Plath was a black woman based on her Bees poem. He humiliates people, does not allow anyone to dare speak let alone offer alternative view. He does not promote joy, love, orpassion in either writing or learning.","Hawkes knows what he's doing. Very smart guy. Yes he's very blunt and almost harsh, but at least he's not sugar coating anything. If you take his comp class you will probably be more proficient in writing than your friends that didn't. It doesn't matter what you write though, as long as you do have a valid point and use correct grammar.","Dr Hawkes has little patience for those not serious about the craft of writing but for those who are, he will help in every way he can.  And he can.  He knows his business.  Trust him, swallow your ego, and listen.  You won't regret it.","Toughest prof I've ever had, but learned so much from him. Honestly, if you can't take his criticism, there's no way you'll survive in the writer's world.

He encourages you to think outside of the box which is something I dont have in a lot of classes. Hes a very sweet man and I have taken him twice so far. Anyone who left bad reviews didnt try to think as abstractly as Dr. Rains does and didnt appreciate his way of thinking.","Dr. Rains is very knowledgable. This class is discussion based upon a music theory book... I hated this class because to me, it had NOTHING to do with psychology. I have no music background and no interest in it. You have to lead class 2 times, 2 tests, cumulative final, 2 papers based upon classical music. I would take someone else for senior sem.","His class can be overall frustrating as he uses no powerpoints and reads off of a paper. Classes are based on discussion and he assigns 10 books to read with only 3 exams (midterm, last test and final) final is cumulative. Did not read one of the books and got b's on his exam as he discusses it in class. He's a caring professor and knows his stuff","Dr. Rains is an awesome professor. I am going to miss him. He is detailed/clear with the work he expects and presents. Dr. Rains has a radical way of thinking and processing information. He does not think in a fixed manner which is a blessing considering some of the professors I have encountered. If you can take a class with Dr. Rains, take it!!!!!","Dr. Rains is hands down my favorite professor for pyschology I had. He has a fake eye which can be distracting but give him a chance. He's really inspirational and intelligent. He assigns a lot of books but if you come to class you can get away with not reading. Participate in the discussions. I'm taking him again. Had him for psych of personality","LOTS of reading and classes are kind of boring but he definitely knows what he's talking about. Does take attendance which is worth 15% of your grade but you're allowed to miss 6 classes without penalty. Anymore and you lose points. You have to lead a discussion but it's not too bad. Overall a good professor.","His classes are heavily discussion-based. You will lead one class discussion, which isn't hard. Reading the textbooks are a must, but he always holds review sessions before each exam so you know what's on the test. He takes attendance. He is also very inspirational to every psych major -- a revered man in the field of psychology.","This class has a lot of assigned reading (of SIX books you have to purchase) and a lot of open discussion. Can be a bore, but if you perk up and pay attention and read like 50% of the material you can pull a B. Attendance also boosts your grade but it's hard to stay interested in this class. If you're an abstract thinker you'll like this class.","grades are only based on attendance &2 tests, he expects you to read upwards of 6 books over the course of the semester &his lectures are boring&confusing. he's a nice guy but his class was unnecessarily hard","Unless you want to buy 4-8 books per class, read them and realize that noone else has read them and that Rains does not even directly test upon the readings, then take him. He's a sweet old man but he's so vague, and I learned nothing about Psych of Personality from him. If you want an easy A, go for it but you won't learn anything from him.","His lectures are a little boring, but overall he is straightforward and a good professor.","Prof. Rains is a genuinely nice person who cares alot about what he teaches. Sometimes he has a hard time gathering all of his thoughts to explain them, but he knows very well his subject and will explain anything as many times as you want. Tests are easy if you pay attention and study. I hear he isnt good for senior sem., though, I'm in abnormal.","Prof Rains is such a nice guy, you can talk about anything is class and he respects you. Yeah you have to read for his class, which is reasonable, duh its college. Tests arent the easiest but they are fair. His sr sem. class made me appreciate him a lot more than when i had him for physiological psych. He is very smart and kind!!!","Dr. Rains is fun! I'm really enjoying this class.  Go ahead, take him. *thumbs up*","What a joke.  He didn't even teach, he had the students run the discussions.  In his intro to the course, he told us \"We're not going to spend time on some topics.  Here they are, let's discuss them.\"  What a quack.","Pretty much, this class is like a book club. You read what you need to and then come in and talk about the psychology/philosophy behind it. It looks like a lot of reading, but it really isn't because the books are really awesome to read. (Hard to believe, huh?) The talking about the book is easy because it goes beyond the book and into real life.","has a socratic method of teaching. he wants you to talk and help to facilitate the learning of the entire class, himself included. If you have a class full of people with social phobia it can be painful, but if people are willing to talk it is enlightening. There is a large reading load for some classes.","Dr. Rains is a very knowledgable professor who cares about his students and loves his job. He is always asking the students for feedback and looking for ways to improve the class. The people who give him bad ratings are simply too lazy to do the readings and probably shouldn't be in college anyway.","No Comments","One of the best profs I ever had!

Doesnt use blackboard and at the end of the quarter has two major assignments and final due, so you're left trying to guess your grade. If you can deal with that then take her class because it is really interesting.","Having taken other CMN profs, I am sorry to say that this woman is probably the worst.

Not only did she help prepare me for law school, but helped me get INTO law school.","Don't bother with this class especially if your thinking about law school. Golemon is inept and unorganized. No idea what her legal background is but I don't trust her knowledge of the subject. Never could tell what she was grading in my writing. Students with legal backgrounds continuously showed errors and corrected her throughout the course.","Ok I don't know wut happened 2 her this semester cuz she only showed up for 1st week then never showed up again. We always had a Sub, & then she had the nerve to grade our assignments at home as if she was there every class teaching. We did everything on our own and yet she graded everything so grumpy. Seemed cool and easy at 1st but We got Screwed","I regret i wasted $550 dollars on this lady, and I want my MONEY BACK! Dr. Golemon is not qualified to teach legal writing she ONLY has a PHD not a JD. I am sick of wasting my precious TIME ,and MONEY on these con/scam artist professors at UHD. I have \"W\" on my transprit because of this fraud AND THAT LEGAL BOOK IS OUTDATED!!!","I like Dr. Golemon.  I did not like this class.  The text book is a 1st yr. law school text and it makes many assumptions about its audience.  Dr. Golemon follows the text closely and expects students to do all book assignments, which are irrelevant to the main assignments that are to be turned in.  Very frustrating, but I made an 'A'.","This class was super easy.  Professor Golemon was helpful, and in my opinion, she treated everyone the same.  Do your work the way she asks, and you'll make an A, it can't get any easier than that.  I spent almost the entire class on the internet, and still made an A.","SUPER EASY!You only have a few assignments which include a resume,cover letter,proposal,instructions, and a memo. As long as you do the work you can show it to her and she will give you suggestions on how to improve it before you turn it in for a grade. There is no excuse for not making an A in this class!She's awesome and knows the field well!","If Dr.Golemon liked you she would help you.If she did not like you she would make being in her class a living hell.I do not think she is a good educator,because she does not treat everyone the same.","I took this \"lady\" for legal writing and she wasn't nice at all. we have to teach ourselves the assignments. She played favorites and she really got on my nerves. I had to dropped because I felt like I wasn't learning anything. However, I saw several comments about her being nice well it might be true for other classes, but not for legal writing!!!","She is great.  The first day, she will tell you exactly how to do well or how to fail.  Follow those words and you are gold.  If you need help, ask for help.  She will only get upset if you need it and don't ask.","If all you want is an easy grade,take her. If you cant get an A in her class then you should probably drop out of college. If you want to actually learn something, don't take her. She is a nice lady, but her teaching style is horrible. You pretty much do the work on your own without any instruction, and then turn it in to see if you did it right.","Laid back class, EASY EASY A , ask questions to learn otherwise lectures are not enough, BUT SHE IS VERY SWEET VERY VERY HELPFUL, best teacher for this kinda course.","Easy grade!  Turn your work in before due date so she can tell you your mistakes & you'll have an easy A.  Laid back class, do not have to attend every class meeting.  Book is very useful for your assignments.","Excellent and well read.","Easy class. Very nice lady","Laid Back class! Just attend and do all work in time! Easy grade!","Pretty good class...she was absent most of the time but pretty laid back class.","Easy grade!","Dr. Golemon was a very good professor. Gives you re-writes on papers that you don't make at least a B on. There is no way you should not do well in this her classes because you refuses to let you bomb out!!","I began with great enthusiasm, however, Dr. Golemon was not in agreement with my choice of topic. So, I changed the topic to reflect my career choice, as she suggested, and still received a poor grade on the paper -- F.  I turned in other assignments and was able to withdraw with WP.

She gives good lectures.","She's an easy teacher and explains things clearly. She is also very helpful outside the classroom. Note: If you're not computer literate, don't take the class. Additionally, since most of the class is programming from examples in the book, a lot of people forget they need to study for the tests.","411 about the teacher.  She is alright with explaining about visual basic.net, but she isn't clear towards the chapter about Arrays(ch8).

She gives a review before each test and goes over everthing the test will cover.  I would definitely take her again.","REALLY HARD!!! SHE EXPECTS TOO MUCH FROM US AND IS ALL AROUND DIFFCULT TO UNDERSTAND!!","I didnt find her easy at all. It was an intro to computer programming class and it felt like we were in an advanced class.

I missed maybe 3 lectures this year and finished with a 97. It is possible to do well in his course, just write down what he is saying!!!","Good class but you should enjoy geography before taking it.

","easy tests and quizes,  gives a lot of free marks. class materials are easy to understand","Loved the material covered in class! Although lectures are long, try to go because exams are based off of lecture.  Holland is a very passionate and kind prof, if you need help do not hesitate to go to him.  Do not let the dullness of the course itself deter you from geo! It gets better and he is a great person.","He leaves information out of his lecture slides. With his extremely monotone and boring way of lecturing, along with the fact these are three hour lectures Tuesday nights from seven to ten in the afternoon you will be lucky to get a full lecture note. I would not recommend this class unless you need the credit.","Kim is a good guy. He won't mess around. The guy knows his stuff.","While I received a high mark in this course, I found Holland's lectures put me to sleep. I think this was mostly due to 1100 being a 3-hour class. If you took any geo courses in high school (Earth and Space included) you'll find 1100 a breeze. Just be warned: 3 hours of lecture from Holland will require copious amounts of caffeine!","Half decent prof and enjoyable course content. Fair exams (no sneaky questions). If you keep up with your reading, it's not hard to get an A or A+. He's not always as boring as others have made out. It's hard to get people engaged with there's 200+ people in a classroom.

Nothing on the exam will be outside of the lectures, but be sure to have the textbook for review and if you want to shoot for an A+ (she does not just give them away).

He only goes over the pictures in the book during class.  Avoid him no matter what, do not take Devender.","Worst teacher I have ever met, he treats people like trash, and thinks he is better than you. If you ask him a question he will let you know how stupid you are and he might give you the answer,...I do not recommend this class.","Took Van Dev for Mammalogy and LOVED it. It is a difficult course, but it is Senior level so it will not be a cake walk. I'm now registered for his Herp class and I am so excited to take it.

You will have to work hard but you will learn a great deal from him.","Had him for Herp. Knows his stuff and is considered an expert in his field. The practicals are tough but he curves at the end. Would recommend if you are interested in the material. He is definitely one of a kind.","Had him for Mammology and he is one of the best resources if Biology is actually something you want to learn instead of just make a good letter grade in. Don't miss classes, read EVERYTHING he assigns, and make sure you memorize everything assigned. You will get a lot out of his classes if you make an effort and invest a lot of time.","Do not take this class. His lectures are incredibly boring and I never knew what to expect on the tests. I wish I had dropped the class.","This was the only professor available for this semester to teach evolutionary bio. There were only 3 grades for the entire course so its very hard to know where you stand, especially if you miss the first test you have to wait till reading day to make it up. He's very frustrating to talk to so rely heavily on your textbook for a decent grade.","I had him for Evolutionary and Herpetology. He is extrememly hard in both but curves the entire class at the end. Overall he is one of my favorite teachers and easily approachable though frustrating at times. He challenges you to think for yourself. If you can't do that, then don't take his class.","Van Devender is a decent teacher and he is indeed insensitive (though most of the people giving these reviews are way oversensitive). But he gives an automatic curve for the class because he TELLS you at the beginning of the semester that he will ask questions that don't have answers. All in all, he evens it out nicely and he wants you to think.","If you like to be spoon fed scientific material thats been stripped down to be easily understood by any average joe, don't take this class. If you want to learn how real biologists do real science, Van Devender will happily guide you through his thought processes, and you will learn. If he doesn't answer your question then it was a stupid one.","This class was absolutely terrible!  It seemed like the whole class was struggling just to pass.  If I studied for hours I was lucky if I got a C- or a D+.  I really tried hard in the class, and got a C by the grace of God.  And, easy on the eyes?!?!  I don't know what that one comment was about.  Maybe they were thinking of the wrong professor.","This professor is THE worst professor in the world.

He's also EXTREMELY nice on the eyes..my favorite section of biology was the human anatomy.. if you know what I mean.","Hard teacher,  You have to memorize mammalian orders, which is useless considering there are not even set in stone as of right now.

He's really nice though, and if you email to ask him for help he'll help you.","It is extremely difficult to understand what this man is saying. During the first few weeks, all I heard was whispers and mumbles. I started to get used to the way he talked, though, and he became easier to understand. He is a nice person, but he is not a good teacher. His tests are hard.

Didn't go to class and read the work on my own, and passed. Do not take him unless you can sit through pointless lectures and then go home and reread everything you did in class!","Jerry is great!! If you attend class you will do fine on the tests. He goes over all the readings in great detail. So you will do good on the test. His tests are easy. He can be unclear at times but its not to bad.

His tests have lots of options so if you do not know something you can skip it. You do group presentaions so you understand better.

As far as a mentally-involved and ideal-challenging class, this is the best. TAKE THIS IF YOU ARE TRULY INTERESTED IN PHILOSOPHY. Grade is calculated by two take home essays (midterm and final). However, he does stick to the philosophy that there is NO PERFECT ANSWER, thus, you will probably not get an A.","I agree with the other person who posted that \"You have to conform perfectly to his opinions on the essays to get an acceptable grade.\" It's true! I always do very well in classes and on essays and I ended up getting my one and only D EVER!","I did not like this professor; he is very opinionated and close-minded when it comes to philosophy, a characteristic which makes teaching the subject difficult.

She is kind and genuinely cares about each individual, but she does go off topic quite a bit. She let us choose how we wanted to take tests (take home, 3 essay questions,) personally paid for books for the us to share, and there is no hw. Easy class, sweet woman","Professor was not at all available outside of class, despite sending numerous emails. Class would be cancelled frequently and without warning. Taught in an informal and far too personal way-- I learned more about her childhood than I did the subject matter. I feel like I wanted money and a semester. Took an entire semester to grade one paper.","I absolutely adore this professor. I had her for the History of Medicine and she was extremely intelligent and passionate about the subject. She truly cares for her students by wanting them to succeed. She doesn't use D2L or email, the best way to contact is by calling/texting her, or by going to her office. She even brought a cake for us one day.","Don't believe all these nay-sayers.  She is a really nice professor who genuinely cares for you.  Never did work in class, minimal reading.  NO tests over the reading just a few presentations and an easy writing assignment... The class was mostly a discussion group. But, if you're ignorant- don't take her classes, because she will argue w you.","She is practically impossible. She won't post grades on D2L the entire semester so you'll have no idea what your final grade will be... doesn't even post midterms. Yeah, she'll drop your lowest test grade, but you only have 3 grades in the class and you'll never know exactly when you're going to have a test or paper due. Always does what she wants.","She's horribly disorganized. Spends all semester reiterating the same point she made the first day. I am not one of those offended by her views; in fact I tended to agree with her. With that said, she's a horrible teacher. Lectures are scattered. Assignment expectations are never clear and you never receive feedback. Nice person, awful teacher. ","The nicest way i can describe this teacher is to say that outside being a professor im sure shes a great person. BUT as a professor she was the worst she never emailed you back, was never specific on her assignments and i honestly don't know why etsu hired her. and her class is only once a week for 2 hours!","DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES TAKE HER!!!! She waits a week before the end of the term to tell you you have two reports due. Her final exam is a joke, you have three question. U will leave this class knowing exactly what you knew going in.","This is the worst class I've taken thusfar!! She goes off subject most off class. She offers study sessions but nothing on the study guide matches what's on the exams and she treats it like everyone already knows the material before she even lectures!! Her graduate student is even less help. Rude and condescending.","she is the most unhelpful professor i have ever had! you never know when things are due, she doesnt post anything on D2L and you can not email her anything because her inbox is always full. Her student helper is extremely rude and isnt helpful either. she is hard to understand and boring to listen to. her tests are extremely difficult.","She is a wonderful teacher. Very educated and cares for her students a lot. If youre a closed minded person who comes to class with a preconcieved notion then yes you probably will get offended, guess what not the entire world thinks like the US. Do your work and communicate with her and you'll be fine :)","With my schedule and having to commute I had no choice in taking this professor. I have never had someone go off topic more in my life. The first test most of the class failed. I actually read the book and still only made a B with the curve she added. I really don't think the book we were to get is the one she uses. Unclear and very arrogant.","You have to work in her class, but she knows a lot about the Middle East and is willing to help you learn the material and write the papers correctly.","Dr. Al-Imad is impossibly disorganized. Good luck knowing when things are due, if you will have a test when it's on the syllabus, etc. No one in the class ever had any idea what was due when. Also, expect to be offended at some point during the semester, if not every week. I was very interested in the Middle East previously, but no more.","I thought I'd loathe this class (love history but not that of the US) but I was pleasantly surprised.  She tells it like it is and doesn't put up with any nonsense, which is quite a nice change.  If you come to class and actually care she'll work with you and you'll do fine.  Very smart, well traveled woman who knows her stuff.  I'd take her again.","Dr. Al Imad is intelligent, unfortunately she has an extremely rich arabi accent that makes it hard to understand her.

HW due every week for participation, but are short and super easy. I'd say the textbook is not really necessary bc he uses the same examples in class from the book, but you might need it for the study guide since his textbook goes a little more in depth.","Dr. Tatum is a very nice professor.

However, he was a monotoned professor and it was only offered as an 8 am so you can see the problem. He does offer extra credit which is part of attendance, and it really does help your grade (with a possible 50 points).","He posted videos of the lectures with the slides online and I never had to go to class. If you pay attention and take notes you will get a good grade. There were only 4 tests in the class and one was optional to make up for your lowest grade or a missed test.","This class was only offered at 8am, but you aren't missing anything besides 1 point of extra credit if you dont go to class. All his lectures are posted online so make sure to watch them. Must study alot for the tests because your grade is based solely on 3 tests + 1 optional final. Textbook is exactly like his lectures since he wrote the book ha","His lectures are extremely long and boring.  I came to class for the first half of the semester but then realized there was no point because he records all the lectures and he pretty much just lectures out of the book. I thought that the class was extremely boring and all blended together. Very difficult to learn the material the way he teaches it.","The class is interesting, but professor Tatum can be a bit bland, so lectures seem to go on forever. I almost never went to class since he posts the lectures online. I also read his book, which is a MUST HAVE. If you view his lectures and read his book in a timely manner,  you're good for exams.","I tried so hard to keep going to class at 8am but towards the end of the semester I just couldn't do it anymore. I would just sit there asking why I was there. His jokes are a little degrading to women. He's just not making the material relatable. Fact is, he is getting older. I respect him but I wouldn't take him as my prof for another class.","My only complaint was the professors monotone voice in which he delivers his lectures which at 8 am, the only time this class is offered makes it easy for you to fall asleep.","He posts all lectures online along with practice questions for each section. Do them!  A lot of them are exactly the same on the tests or very similar. There's 3 exams and a final that is cumulative. Optional final. If you take the final, he drops your lowest test out of the 4. This class was hard , so really put in a lot of time and study.","His class is based of 3 exams and and optional cumulative final so there's really no room for error. Attendance is not necessary if you dedicate time into learning the material on your own time. Watch the lectures online and read the book, DEFINITELY do the sample question because they are on the tests! careful though,wording might vary on the test","Tatum is really nice, but a little dry. The lecture is at 8 AM, but all of them are prerecorded online so you don't need to go to class, but you definitely need to listen to the lecture. Your grade is based off of only three midterms and an optional cumulative final to replace your worst grade. Not a bad class at all, but definitely not my favorite","It's a hybrid course but the online part is not required, just a study tool if you want it. He talks forever and coughs a lot. pretty old guy, cool and chill. He posts all of his lectures online and you should listen to them if you want to pass. Also do the sample questions online bc they are the same as the test. just take notes.","He's is very dry and uses the same jokes for every class.  His tests require you to be very familiar with the book, and taking notes in class does not matter.  The test questions are very specific and often annoying.","Attendance is not mandatory at all.

Really straightforward on what to study (his midterm/exam is heavily based on lecture material). Reading heavy course, but his lectures are a good reiteration of the readings so don't stress on getting every reading done! ","Tryed fighting my grade many times and he refused to change it. Worst class Ive ever taken because of the strict details needed.","Good lecturer who teaches interesting content. Has fair expectations. The paper was only 8 pages and the exams were very reasonable. Just go to class and do your readings. It's not that deep.","Loads of people recommended this prof to me but I found him to be a tough marker and to be very rude during student presentations by always interrupting with snide comments half way through.

Not only that, extremely helpful and approachable. It's easy to connect with her, and she is also one of the more easier graders I've seen. I'd definitely recommend a class with Dr. Stafford!","Dr. Stafford is the best prof I've had at MUN to this day. She is so intensely passionate about philosophy, and her lectures, far from being boring, cookie-cutter factsheets, make you actually think and stay with you after the class has ended. She's so engaging and so, so sweet. She is the reason I am doing a Philosophy degree!","While I found her alright to talk to personally, in class she is boring and expects everyone to have deep intellectual insights on everything when most of us are fighting a losing battle to keep our eyes open.  But if you try to pay attention and take good notes, you should do ok.","Toni's a passionate teacher, but her articulation's very unclear b/c she doesn't simplify. She can be friendly, but she's also a bit off-balance - definitely the 'hit or miss' type, so I'd plan my visits accordingly.","An engaging prof. If you don't go to class and expect to get by on notes, don't bother. Explains the material very well. One of the best profs I've had so far.","Very clear with subject matter. Managed to handle complex topics in a manner which made it significantly easier. If you don't go to her classes, you won't be able to copy notes from others (her board notes are haphazard and random), but if you actually go to class, pay attention, contribute and work, you have little chance of doing badly.","I hated her. She was disorganized, unclear, unprofessional, never gave notes...taught class like it was a second or third level course...very very boring. Save yourself the anguish and suffering...take my advice","i would consider this philosophy class one of the most agonizing things i've ever gone through. It's impossible to have any type of reasonable dialogue with her. She treats students like ignorant infants, forgetting that she is teaching a ****ing INTRODUCTORY COURSE. she's the epitome of the intellectual elitist. save yourself the bother.","Found her class a little boring and difficult to go along with. She's helpful where possible but spend most classes going over simple grammer issues. We are not in high school anymore. If people are having grammer problems they can go to the writing center.","Dr.Stafford is great, funny too. Im sure that she was late for class every day!!! But she is a good prof and she knows her stuff!","Remember to always keep in mind, she is smarter than you. Impossible to pull the wool over her eyes. Great prof.","She is a very nice lady, but a bit confusing when explaining things. And I wish she didn't show up late for class all the time.","the best professor ever! she is nice, very smart, and obviously enjoys philosophy and teaching.","She's crazy & cheesy...but she knows her stuff.

I took this class without knowing it is an online course. If you ever needed help she was there in class almost all the time ! As long as you do your work you will receive a good grade. I got a B because i never did my homework. Class is not mandatory. Gives a TON of extra credit !!","So happy took this course. I was a little reluctant to take math online because I am not great at it. But the final is Friday and I have 102% in the class. There is extra credit the first week and the weekly quizzes are easy compared to 40 practice problems per section.

Also, had Dr. Licari for Principles of Marketing and loved her lectures.","Good professor and very knowledgable! Tries to get the class involved during lectures. For tests, outline and read each chapter. The first test I studied from my notes and didn't do well, but I outlined for the second and did so much better!

She uses her plethora of experience in different fields as examples. Very clear on exam (5) material, but some questions are definitely tricky.

Cheerful, loves to answer questions. LOTS of tests. Reading test due before every class and attendance test in class. I didn't like the Physics unit, but everything else was like an AP class in high school.","I really appreciated Prof. Kowallis. He is kind and it is clear that he wants his students to succeed. This course was one of the more difficult, or maybe time-consuming courses though. There were quizzes for each chapter and lots of tests. I had to spend considerable time in the TA lab, which was helpful. Granted, science isn't my #1 subject.","It's been years but I really enjoyed Dr Kowallis!","I'm not a fan of science, so that may be part of the problem, but I felt like I didn't know what Kowallis was talking about most of the time. He wasn't necessarily boring, but he wasn't super entertaining either. He was mediocre. The class itself isn't hard, it's test heavy. I felt like he got distracted during lectures and often went off topic.","The fact that I hate PS100 has less to do with Dr. Kowallis and more to do with the structure of the class, but he really did not do anything to make it better. Lectures were boring and all a restatement of what the chapter for the day said. You can tell that he's been teaching this class for a decade or two","Brother Kowallis is amazing! He brings the Spirit into class every day! He was very understanding when I had health problems halfway through the semester. We didn't have a final, only a final project, which was great! The material is interesting and he really knows his stuff. He helped me solve a block in my family tree in about 2 hours!","Dr. Kowallis gives really good lectures! He knows all of his students and makes sure everyone is involved and understands. The demonstrations were really cool to watch as well!","I love him! He has been teaching for a long time now and he still has it! He really cares about you and makes the class feel like a family instead of students.","Dr. Kowallis is wonderful. He wants each of his students to succeed. The nature of PHYS100 meant a lot of work, a lot of content, and a lot of tests. But, as far as Dr. Kowallis goes, he was very willing to help us as best he could. For the class, I would suggest going to the TA lab.","I adore this professor. This was by far my favorite class...I made lifelong friends and a lot of that is because the teacher made the class friendly and let us get to know eachother. The professor learns all our names and cares about each of us. He wants us to succeed.","Professor Kowallis is a great teacher and a great man but many of the aspects of the class are dictated by the nature of the course as opposed to his teaching style. As a non-science major this class was difficult for me but I learned a ton. The textbook is your bible for this class. Utilize the help offered by TAs. Attend class and lab.","The best religion class. He shares interesting information and I learned so much that I can apply to my own life. I learned a lot about my family history and he is such a caring professor. He goes out of his way to help you  with anything. No tests, only quizzes and assignments which are actually fun. Highly recommend!","Brother Kowallis was a great teacher for Family History. He really knows what he is talking about and is always willing to help any student with any problem they have.

I already lack much desire to work on the frustrating world of family history. Did teach me a lot though.","He explains things clearly and takes every question seriously. A genuinely good man who really knows his stuff. He's funny too and keeps lectures interesting. I would recommend him to anybody.","Dr. Kowallis is a WONDERFUL teacher.

She explained the material extremely well. However, for advanced auditing I feel like she tried to cram to much material into 2 credit class not spending enough time on it. Hence we had very little preparation for the final which was made out of CPA questions. Not the best grader too.","Although her personality can be a bit abrasive, she does explain the material, which can be a bit complicated, very well.  Also, a nice grader.  Group projects suck.","The class materials can be very complex. Her notes in class are fairly easy to follow but her exams are absolute killers!

Thank You Dr. Price!!!!","Dr. Price is a God. Price has the ability to effectively communicate ochem without any discrepancies.

Dr. Price is passionate about his work and cares very much about the well being of his students.","Price was a very nice professor. Very smart and knows his chem! he has a good personality and is always there for help","Dr. Price makes Organic easy and fun. Just print out the powerpoint slides and pay attention in class. Then go home and do the practice problems online and in the textbook. If you have any problems, visit him and go over them. If you can do all this, then you should be able to get no less than a B in the course. Who said Organic was impossible?","I didn't have him for class, but had him for lab.. Definitely the best lab instructor.. very helpful and always there to answer questions..I hated organic, but loved going to lab because of him..","Price is an awesome o-chem prof.

He has tangents but there absolutely hilarious, and often very interesting.  Love the one about being stopped on the autobahn in Germany","Epitomizes the title teacher.

Take her for any class you can, it'll be a great experience!","although she can seem condescending and harsh at times, she is a very nice lady.  yes, she's demanding with papers, the midterm, and final, but gives helpful feedback and rewards effort.  you do actually have to read most of the books, but some aren't that bad.  do your papers ahead of time and she will look over them- very helpful!","She's liberal, no doubt about it. But she's a fairly interesting teacher, although very demanding.

Expects students to write at graduate school level on papers and research as much as she does.","she claims the whole point of the course is to open your mind to other perspectives, but reprimands you for adopting opinions other than her own.  the material you'll read is very interesting, but her lectures are unclear and she's condescending when you meet with her outside of class.  she'd be a much better professor if she wasn't so arrogant.","Prof. Crane is an ok teacher but a horrible grader. YOu have to take alot fo notes and she screws you over with your grade.

His sides are very important as well as his little drawings, and he did refer to the textbook on the final exam. A lot of information to retain, but worth it if you're interested in society and law course!","Just because one is charismatic does not mean one is a good professor.

Generally just a very kind and sweet man, and the class itself was enjoyable.","I was one of many students taking Logic to fulfill my quantitative reasoning requirement, and found it far preferable to math. Quizzes are unannounced and cannot be made up. Cohen is genuinely willing to help students, and can recommend tutors for the harder units. Attendance isn't mandatory, but he knew all 70 students by name in my class.","Professor Cohen is very passionate about Logic and he's always willing to help after class. Also his beard is epic.","As some have mentioned, Professor Cohen is a very helpful professor who cares deeply about his students actually learning the material. More than that, he'll get you interested in Philosophy even if you don't think you are. Lastly he's a great guy and is always helpful.","Cohen is the man. He cares so much about all of his students and is super helpful and accommodating. He lets the class decide on essay topics to be sure we're writing about what we can write well. Even if you don't like philosophy take a class with him.","Funny, very helpful guy. Concepts are either \"get it or you don't\" and sometimes lectures were very boring. But outside of class he's amazing-so willing to explain everything and clarify it using personal examples.","As a previous poster noted, in the logic class you either get it or you don't. I didn't think Cohen's lectures were very clear and despite really studying and doing the work, I found a lot of the quizzes / tests very difficult. If you aren't good with abstract concepts, this is not the class for you. I was really confused all semester.","Interesting class but Cohen bored me to death. Maybe it was because I don't do well in lecture situations, but I couldn't seem to pay attention during class. Watch out for the pop quizzes.","A great guy in and out of class. He made what could have been an awful class a great one. Always knew what he expected from you in class, graded fairly and got the class involved in great discussions. His test study guides were really helpful too, and he didn't give much work at all.","Dan is just freakin' awesome!","One of those classes that you either \"Get it\" or you don't. I found it clearly explained tho some of my classmates really struggled with it. Overall, I'd give this class very high marks and really glad I took it. But why did Colby allow me to graduate with this class as my only math credit instead of forcing me to also take calculus?","Finished his basic logic course years ago but still remember it; I've since studied logic elsewhere, but he explained things the most clearly and simply; no better person to get started in phil with.","really wants you to do well-- encouraging and always makes time to help you.","Cohen is on top of what he's doing always. He's an extremely qualified professor who's very intelligent, humorous, witty, and engaging.

His knowledge and passion for Russian history is obvious and makes the lectures so much better. I can't say enough to describe how great the course was. He speaks at a good pace and with a certain rhythm that just keeps you hooked on the lecture. LOVED THIS CLASS!","This man breathes and lives Russian history. My favourite elective from my 4 years at Carleton. I knew very little coming into the first lecture and came out with a wealth of knowledge. You know a prof's good when you can listen to him attentively without slides. For a one-year course he teaches a ton, from the vikings to Putin. Recommended.","Must come to class if want to pass, reading the textbook wont substitute what this dude presents in lectures. Im just gonna say that first class had about 50 people, last class about 7 people and 30 showed up for exam. He is interesting but very old school professor. Oh, he also speaks very quietly so must sit in the front to hear him!","Extremely knowledgable about Russian History! Makes lectures interesting by adding in his own amusing commentary. Brings history to life! One essay, one midterm and one exam, all weighty but he gives time and helpful hints. He is a very good prof","Professor Elwood is the most inspiring professor I have ever had. His lectures are very witty, engaging, and thought-provoking. He cares about his students and, although you have to work hard in his class, he provides you will all the necessary tools and inspiration. You will WANT to work hard in his class! Trust me. He brings history to life!","Genuinely nice guy whos concerned about progress of his students. Very knowledgeable about Russia and history in general. Papers are assigned well in advance so no trouble with deadlines. Class is definitely for those truly interested in Russia, as exam short answer questions often focus on obscure persons/events. Otherwise very enjoyable class!","good prof, but exams are way too focused on key terms with little emphasis on what to study for.  Exams are difficult to study for given this amount of material in lectures. Dont take unless you have a big interest in Russian History.","Great Professor! Extremely organized which I really appreciate. He always started exactly on time and ended exactly on time. He would also stick to syllabus exactly and cover the material very very well. Also a very fair marker. You can tell he is very passionate about history and it made Russian history great!","Great proff! I took his History of Russia class and he was very knowledgeable about his topic and encouraging with his students. His lectures follow along with the textbook, so so long as your taking notes or doing the readings thoroughly. The videos are useless and boring,  but overall he is fantastic, funny and very supportive. definite Yes!","He really knew his stuff. It was hard to get used to his style at first, but I learnt alot. Also he was very easy to talk to and extremely helpful with papers.","One of the best Prof's I've ever had the chance to learn under. This is seriously one of the funniest guys you'll ever meet; His knowledge on Russian history is second to none; he would do an entire lecture without notes.  I highly recommend him to anyone that's looking into Russian Studies","AWSOME PROFF ! !  He looks like mr. Weather B from Archie comics! He is awsome, clear, structured lectures, great backround knowldge, this guy knows everything about Russian History! Come prepared for lectures or you'll be lost. Exams are hard, alot of marks given for specific terms. But if you come to class take good notes all you have to do is gl","He is the best proffessor I have ever had. I always looked forward to going to lecture.  The only problem I found with his class was the exams though I and many of my classmates did very well on them, they were still extremely hard. I studied 3 times as many hours for one Russian History exam then all my other courses.","He's a fantstic professor, and knows his material inside out.  Hoever, if you are not prepared to show up to class and prepare properly for exams, don't bother with his classes.  Little tip: all of his old exams are on file in the Unicentre copy shop, they provide EXCELLENT study guides.","I loved the lectures and he knows his stuff and is super helpful but the exams were KILLER.","Good Prof, he REALLY knows everything about Russian history... everything. He's a fair marker too and is quite approachable. Complaint: Midterm and exam were not properly designed. There is WAY too much weight given to definitions and not enough to overall theme comprehension. Still, the subject matter alone makes this class worth it!","I am currently in my second year, I have had more then nine different courses and no prof. made me feel more like a person then Dr. Elwood. Truly passionate about what he teaches, knows what he's talking about and is always willing to help. A shame there aren't other profs like him.","not horrible, issue is with the fact that it doesn't feel as if he takes his subject to seriously, lectures are ok, but reads from the notes -- feels to formal","Really knows the subject and posses the proper resources to find out pretty much everything to know about the subject.

He likes French & is decently clear, so an A or B is doable. But he's snobby, blunt & unaccommodating.  He lost my test, no apology.

If you are trying to get easy marks, this is not the class for you. He makes sure you deserve your mark, and that is part of why he's such a great prof.","O'Hagan teaches French and its grammar very clearly even for those who don't know grammar in say English. And since his native language is English, he knows where anglophone students are coming from. So he knows when to give a translation for a difficult word, unlike the native french profs. I wish he taught all the french grammar courses.","If you do not have prior experience in a French immersion setting do not take O'Hagan's class. His primary focus is grammar. Extremely challenging to do well without a solid foundation in French (above and beyond high-school/college level exposure). Avoid. Avoid. Avoid.","Seems like a knowledgeable and passionate man for a French professor but teaches grammar lessons orally with little or no use of visual aid. He also digresses at length about material marginally related to the course. Attendance was not that helpful for test review and independent learning is necessary for success in course.","O'Hagan is a good teacher. I can't say his class was interesting, but that is the fault of the extremely dry course material. He is clear and willing to go over things multiple times. He is a fair marker, as the marks on compositions are calculated mathematically by the number of errors made.","It's obvious that he is passionate about the language, and very familiar with grammar rules. It is tough to ask him questions when you don't understand something though, because he tends to get caught up in the grammatical errors of your question itself, and then get completely sidetracked. Tough marker too, do not take this class for easy marks!","Professor O'Hagan is very detailed, informative, and engaging. I'm pursuing French above the 102 level and I'm hoping to find a lecture he's teaching.","I could tell many in my class didn't enjoy Professor O'Hagan's teaching, but I feel very fortunate to have attended. Maybe his old-fashioned mannerisms make him an awkward teacher, but his instruction was meticulous and interesting. He is definitely the best professor I've ever had.","Kind and respectable man but not exactly the best at teaching :( His English accent is quite noticeable despite his fluency in French, and sometimes it's a bit unclear of what he's talking about.

I found his power point slides difficult to follow, and his lecturing seemed to jump all over the place. He could be difficult to hear, and the questions he tested on came straight from the textbook instead of his lecture material. Seemed like a nice enough guy, but not a fan of his teaching style.","Dr. Phillips is a great guy! However, his lectures tend to be all over the place. He doesn't give lecture notes or diagrams to go off of. He was pretty fair on the midterms for this class, but he made the exam EXTREMELY difficult. He asks very specific questions!! If you read the textbook and know every detail in the book, you will do fine","Dr. Phillips teaches from the book completely. That wouldn't bother me if his tests were fair but he asks unnecessarily specific questions and his exams are like pointless trivia, they do not test real knowledge. He is an incredibly nice man but he does not know how to test.","Teaches out of the textbook. Doesn't have a blackboard thing to post important diagrams that he SAYS ARE IMPORTANT. More than half the class failed the first exam. Too hard a marker for being such a bad teacher. Asks weirdly specific questions about the most bizarre things, rather than the chapters that he focussed on A LOT during class. Phlegmy. ","Exams are 80% short/long answers. He grasps the water bottle several times in the lecture but never drinks it. His voice is unclear/stuffy (?) and says eh..eh..eh.. too much which becomes very hard to integrate bits of information. I find it hard to listen to his lecture, even from the recordings.","clear","He makes the exams very hard. I would not recommend taking this course unless you like to see your GPA drop.","Great lecturer, really knows his stuff, very enthusiastic. But seriously, he does not need to make the exams so hard!

Her rubrics and essay questions are so unclear which makes it hard to do well. She's also a very tough marker. She doesn't mark what you wrote, she marks what she thinks you should have written (ie \"you could have said ___\" or \"you could have also connected ____\"... )","Anth of Reproduction is clearly Dr Mitchell's speciality. She enjoys it, the class is lively, and the material is clearly presented. Mitchell has a fun sense of humor in the class, and makes everything really approachable. That being said, go to lecture, it was THE most useful aspect of her class for passing the tests.","I was excited about the course, always had a good rapport with my profs before hand, but not now. I found her hard to talk to and very unwilling to explain her assignments further.  I found her extremely biased on her subject material, which felt out of place in an academic environment.","I would take another class with LMM in a heartbeat. Her lectures are very interesting, and have a logical progression. She is clear in what she expects, was sort of a hard marker but its university, profs aren't supposed to just hand out A's. Course load was manageable, never felt bogged down. Attendance is mandatory  (as expected)","HORRIBLE. I usually get along with profs very well. She seems to be approachable but when I walked in during her office hours she was not helpful, she was very judge-y and I often left her office feeling like she did not like me. she is also a HARD MARKER. You need to write down everything you learned during her lectures or else will fail midterm.","If you are somebody who has a lot going on in your life and need a bit of slack, then do not take a course with her, she denied my request for an extension.  Needed a dr. note or to go see a counselor.  She is cold and serious during lectures, difficult and intimidating to talk to.  I loved the course content, but I despise her teaching methods.","amazing prof. I only took 400a with her which is a 4th year theory class and it was understandably difficult. She is a very hard marker but I learned more in that class than I have in any other cultural/theory class at  Uvic.  She has very high expectations for her students, especially in this type of class but if you work hard it will pay off","I took her for ANTH 304 and 400A, so I don't know how her other classes are, but I think she's a great, helpful, interesting, funny prof. Very smart, her grading takes a little to get used to but if you pay attention to what she wants you'll do fine, easily. 304 has a 15 page paper but I actually enjoyed writing it.","Great Professor. Very Helpful, clear, and funny!","Absolute horror on grading. Although I attended every lecture, took notes and completed readings, and despite I am an 'A' honours student, she failed me on my midterm, which was actually pretty well written and I was forced to drop. She told me if I aced everything else, I would end with an A-. Under her teaching you will only learn to hate. :(","I think I was one of 3 guys in the class (Anth of reproduction). I felt she was very fair and interesting.  She was very clear about what she was looking for. Lectures were great, summarized what you needed to know! Wish other  profs would sit in and learn how to teach.  I would and have recommended her. Unexpectedly my favorite course of the year.","Much better teacher than her mother. Made the material more interesting than  thought would be possible. 100% femenist, and 75% ****, but not enough to bother any of the guys. The topics were all fairly women-related and I cant blame her for feeling like the guys have nothing useful to contribute to the discussion. Would take her class again 100%","Seriously great prof! Interesting, funny, approachable and smart.","Great Prof. You can tell that she really enjoys the subject. No text book which was really nice. Her lectures are intriguing and she encourages class discussion. Excellent teacher I absolutely loved the class.","Dr. Mitchell was GREAT in this class--totally in her zone.

Plus you couldn't ask for a more interesting or applicable topic.","Yes - definitely entertaining! Although I heard the other section for this class was easier. Three papers worth 45% all together.. one was due in the midst of finals which sucked - but the marking on the papers was fair. Bell curved the exam marks which was good because the text was impossibly boring and long - and the exam was heavily based on tex","He's the man!","I never once stayed awake in his class.  Exams are based on his lectures and the textbook (he barely covers anything in his lectures that are in the textbook)  was a bit confusing","Loved the lectures;  this prof is very animated and, honestly, quite goofy!  He'll keep you interested.  Pay attention; his tone will tell you what will be on the exam.  Both exams were very easy;  I had virtually not time to study and still pulled off an A-.","Interesting subject, exams are very easy if you study well. The textbook is a MUST, about 80% of the exams are drawn from the book. The best thing about this prof is that he uses pertinent and easy-to-remember experiments to explain different social psych concepts. Bit of an odd duck he is, I must say. But that just makes class more entertaining.","Out of 75 questions on the midterm exam, only 6-10 came from the lectures. Know the book!  He is a great prof and offers many tips to help students inprove.  Try the online quizzes from the textbook website, they help somewhat... good luck :S","really great class and really great prof!","I had no idea what the man was ever talking about, the TA for this class taught some of the lectures and spoke barely any english, no real structure or ANY of the lectures, thank god for open book ...","Great funny professor! Teaches with a style that makes it fun to go to class ... exams were fair, but you must read the textbook!

He doesn't throw curve balls.","I'll say this, he's an odd one. I did enjoy his class though. Also, do not listen to these other people, it is not hard to make an A if you put forward any effort.","Really boring lecture where he would only go over part of the material and test on all of it.  Test problems were all over-complicated problems and almost no assignments to help grade.  Advise to not take his class or work your butt of to try to make a C","Incredibly difficult tests. Of 44 people in the class, 32 failed the first exam. The only way to get a good grade is memorizing the book. One exam question asked about an example from class, if you didn't remember it exactly as he wrote it down, ten points off. Nice huh?","Very boring classes. I know the material is like that, but he doesnt even try to make it interesting. Also, extremely stubborn when it comes to giving extra marks. Impossible to even put forth your argument, because he's not listening - he's convinced he is right and whatever anyone else says is rubbish. Did not like this class at all.","This guy's reputation is worse than he really is.  Lectures might be a little dull, but the subject matter (discrete math) is coma-inducing, so he works with what he has.  He is a PHD in math, so don't expect any glossing over the proofs.  I currently have a C average in the class, but it has nothing to do with unfair grading.  Tests are hard.","a few words of advice: DON'T TAKE HIM!!!!","Overall, he's a HORRIBLE teacher. He's the weirdest person I've ever met, by far. His lectures are boring and unclear at times. Furthermore, his lectures do not help much for labs. I also think the university needs to drug test him more often...","By far the WORST professor/teacher I've ever had. It's ridiculous that Clemson has yet to question his teaching abilities, despite all of his \"credentials\". His entire persona just leaves a bad taste in my mouth...","First of all, Dr. Jacobs is probably the weirdest guy I've ever met. I'm pretty sure he was tripping acid throughout multiple classes. Somehow, he does do a nice job of explaining the material and will go very slow through examples until you understand. His test aren't too bad but you must memorize all the theorems precisely, little partial credit.","Excellent Teacher. Highly recommended. Tests are straightforward. If it is not covered in class, it will not be on test. Come to class, take notes, an easy A!!!","Horrible horrible horrible teacher.  Memorize everything to a T, or else it's wrong.  Even if you have the general concept, one word wrong will get you the entire question wrong.  You don't learn anything through this except how to memorize.  Horrible.","I have known people who are taking Goddard and are struggling. Jacobs is the best. Not only is this class an easy A, but you actually will learn the information. Just come to every class and take good notes, there arent a lot. The only programs he asks you for are ones that he has previously given you. If he hasnt taught it, it wont be on the test.","Prof. Jacobs is a good teacher; his quizzes and tests are fair.  He rewards students who come to class every time and if you understand the material, which is not hard, you will get an A. I hear he kicks ass at harmonica.","Talks to slow, and his tests are really hard. You have to memorize rediculous algorithms that have nothing to do at all with your knowledge of programming. He makes class more memorization than application. Do not pick his class if you have another choice.","Overall he really wasn't too bad... I managed to pull of an A in this class but that is only because he curved my grade (i was expecting a solid B).  Many people complained about him but that's because they didn't go to all of his classes. If you go to class, go to every lab (i got a zero on one), and memorize stupid algorithms  you'll get an A","The worst, absolute worst teacher I've ever had. From pre-school through my masters work.I also just found this site so to show how terrible this professor is, I had to come rate him even though I've already received my undergraduate degree.I do not understand why Clemson continues his employment.","If you can memorize ALL the theories, you'll probably get an A. Though miss a single word in a theory on the test, and it is usually 10-20 points off. Jacobs has a Math background, and I hear Math majors have an easier time with his class. I don't recommend him for 350. So you decide","You want to know how much I hated this guys class?  I graduated 5 years ago.  Just found this site, anyway I had his Comp Theory class. He told the class that the final weeks' information would not be on the final.  So I didn't study it, suprise, the final consisted of only the last weeks info F----","Quite possibly the worst teacher that has ever taught at Clemson.

Definitely have to keep up with the readings (I learned the hard way), but I thought he was very challenging, in a good way, and sincere. As an advisor/mentor, he's EXTREMELY helpful. He has an INFINITE amount of knowledge stored in his brain, encompassing a vast array of subjects. My only critique: Write more comments on papers.","Best professor I have had at UD so far.  He is one of the smartest guys you will ever meet, he knows everything about every Brit Lit writer and makes the lectures pretty interesting.  He is a very fair grader and the tests are very fair as well.  He does not try to trick you, wants youtot do well.  I definately reccommend this class.","Nicest guy you'll ever meet.  His lectures are a bit dry and boring at times, but early English literature isn't fun for the most part.  Fairly easy grader and tries his best to help everyone.","Semi-boring class but a really nice guy. If you visit him during his office hours he really tries to get to know you! Make sure you do the reading, because if you have my luck you will be stuck doing group work with a bunch of kids who didn't read it! He doesn't call on you unless you want him too.","Dr. Brock is a really nice guy.  For the most part class was easy.  Reading makes things a lot easier but there are ways around it.  Only a couple of 1 or 2 page papers.  I would recommend to take this class.","I would highly recommend this professor for ENGL205. Definitely need to read all assignments, but there is only a midterm, final, and 2 2-page papers. Really fun and interesting. :)","Makes class fun, great help at office hours.  Very approachable and really cares about his students!","Nice guy, class is dull, little discussion, just lecturing, midterm impossible, final not as bad. DO THE READING!!!","Pretty decent class. It was a lot of reading and lectures were boring sometimes, but Brock can be funny and he knows his Shakespeare. PBL sucked but there were only three papers and one of them was two pages long. It's not an easy easy A, but if you do the reading and are a decent writer you can expect an A.","Brock is a great guy. Went to office hours once, and found out how intelligent and caring he is about his students. Funny guy, but sometimes a boring lecturer. Not very specific though, when asking him how I should revise my paper, his response was \"just fix up some things and straighten things out and you'll be fine.\" Great old man.","Just go and pay attention, you should get at least a B.  He is very knowledgable and passionate, and covers just about everything that will be on the tests.","Excellent professor.  Although there was a LOT of reading, he made it interesting by not only giving you the summary of what happened, but explained why it was important and how it was influenced by the contextual cues.  Isn't what I would call an easy A, but definitely worth the work just for the sheer knowledge Brock has to offer his students.","Simply put, don't take this class with Brock.  If you have any pride in what you write, or any self-respect for that matter, you're better off going elsewhere for Brit I.  He somehow managed to take a subjective course and makes it objective.  He rewards rudimentary crap with decent grades and actual substance with extreme debasement.

I recommend him any day!","This professor does not know how to lecture.  He says statments like questions, which really annoys me.

If at all possible, avoid taking a class with this professor.","I love Kebbede! He is very sweet and soo knowledgeable. He answers all questions clearly, willingly and succintly and is an expert on the Middle East. He's so much fun.","Very unclear in his teaching, can hardly understand him.

It was a good class. It's not too hard, but u have to learn quickly how she wants you to write your papers.","Her class is generally fair and not a hard work load. Come to class if you want to be on good terms with her. She is a little rigid and knows what she wants. Not the most friendly but I learned a lot about grammer.Our class had fun disscussions as well. But when it came to poetry it was a little more fast paced and writing was tough.","She does not grade fairly at all. Her nephew and his friends were in my class and of course they all got A's and were treated as favorites. They even joked about how well they had it made. I had another English teacher review my essays after receiving D's & C's.  He completely disagreed with her grading and agreed she is a hypocrite and not fair.","As long as you do your projects and turn in the work, it is an easy class.  The hardest part is the essays, but there isn't too many and they aren't long ones.","Don't take her! I had her for comp 1 and shes some what easy but she doesn't grade the essays fair, AT ALL!","She tells you what she wants but if she doesn't like your writing style your screwed","This class was supposed to get you oriented to life at Tech. It didn't. She is a hypocrite. She would talk on her cell phone while writing ABSOLUTELY NO CELL PHONES on the board. She clearly thinks she is better than her students. She is rude and mean. Avoid!","I had Mrs. Nancy for both Comp 1 and 2. She is a great teacher and really helps you understand what you need to know. Her class can get boring at times but it's english! KEEP THE CELL PHONES PUT UP! She grades harder on her essays for Comp 1 than she does for Comp 2. She isn't strict about attendance.","I really liked having Mrs. Cox as a teacher. She really wants every student to do well. Some lecture days seem really long..but that's normal. It is an easy A if you do all the work.","I loved this class! Mrs. Cox is very clear and tells you exactly what is expected. She's very helpful and wants you to do well. Very sweet lady! She has high standards and will kick you out of class if she catches you with your phone out, but as long as you do your homework and follow her instuctions it's a very straightforward class.","She makes what she wants from you very clear. If you are having problems not understanding she will gladly help you. She truly wants everyone to pass her class unlike many professors. She will know your capabilities and she will make you live up to them. She has made me a better writer overall.","I didn't like this class at all.  I didn't think she graded essays fair and she wouldn't help and tell you what you did wrong on them.  I would drop this class if you have her!","She is a good teacher. Her grading is a little hard, but she is fair. She helps you to understand what you are reading and is very concerned if her students do well.","i would recommend taking this teacher for Comp 1. You have 6 essays to write, but they aren't that hard. You do quite a bit of grammar work but none of it is difficult. She really cares about her students and is willing to help you out however she can.","I did not like her class.  Their are six essays, 12 presentations, two poetry journals, and two short story journals.  I would suggest Dr. Lake for Comp.2","shes really nice. greads hard. She is willing to help you get better greads on papers.","On the essays she is pretty tough on grading, but homework grades are very easy points. Every grammar quiz we took in a group of four people.

So disrespectful and not professional. Wont reply to emails, huge ego. The class is all tests and one group project. Tests are purposely made to be tricky.

Non consistent grading criteria and seems to never be happy with any work.

Very difficult person and grader.","I normally don't write reviews, but this one is necessary. Do not take her if you can help it. It seems as though she makes up what she wants to talk about in lecture as she goes because it doesn't follow the syllabus whatsoever. Her grading is harsh and feedback is not helpful. Doesn't answer questions or emails. Makes fun of students.","Melissa Burnett is one of the worst professors I have had. Her lectures are pointless, she promises bonus points that are never given and she gives unhelpful feedback.

Do not take her if you have any interest in Advertising, she'll make you hate it. Creative is not about making creative ads, it's an event planning class where she shoves her personal agenda down your throat.","She means well, but can't keep herself organized. She has too much going on with Ad Team and her grad class. She wants you to work extremely hard and gives hardly any points. Her class is frustrating, although she is very enthusiastic and wants her students to do well.","Unless you go and talk to her or are on ad team, you are SCREWED","Do not take this class unless you absolutely must! She teaches NOTHING and expects you to learn by trial and error, while recieving poor grades at the same time. I spent HOURS on projects to later learn that we got absolutely NO CREDIT for them. Some of them got an occasional 10 points. Join Ad team and you might have a chance at an A in the class","Not a bad class.  Just go to class.  Reviews are not very clear but just study the online quizes.  Also if your in class you get easy quiz points.  An easy B for sure.","She is a great professor, study power points for tests and you will do ok.  Pretty funny, likes to keep class entertained.  Just a couple of tests and final.  Likes to give bonus points on Fridays!!","She is really one of the best teachers I've had. When it comes to getting a job, she is hard on you so that you learn and can really make in the real world. I now have a job, and I learned so much from her. Plus one of the reasons she works you so hard is so that you have respectable examples that are necessary for getting a job.","Awful class.  Don't expect to get any points for effort.  Grades only on the final product.  Go suck up ALL SEMESTER in her office hours and it will improve your grade.  Overly Critical by far and it has NOTHING to do with being LAZY-it has everything to do with how much you kiss up-COMPLETELY SUBJECTIVE-NO TESTS. You get what she gives you.","Burnett is by far the worst teacher I have EVER had. She is completely condesending and has an awful personality.

The homework/project takes forever to do, and the content is DENSE. The exams are rough, but the curve is generous. CHEG231 has the workload of two or three 3-credit courses. Good luck.","Worst professor I've ever had. Lectures are boring. Slides have no information relevant to the exam. Mostly deriving equations in book. No clear grading rubric; arbitrarily assigns letter grades without releasing final exam/final project grades or cuttoffs. You cant do anything about it since you never see the final. Went from an A to C+ from final","Thermo is definitely the hardest class I've ever taken, but Dr. Buttrey does a great job of explaining the material. If you have questions, just ask right away otherwise your confusion will just build until you can't do anything about it. Definitely the smartest man I've ever met. 20 hours of homework per week. Good luck.","He is passionate about what he teaches and his PowerPoints are extremely detailed and descriptive. At the start of the semester he wasn't great at getting across the information, but by the end we did a lot of in-class practice problems which helped tremendously. The key to his class is asking for help when you need it and not procrastinating.","Just horrible. Solutions are filled with mistakes and does a terrible job explaining the already difficult concept of thermo.  Smart guy, but can't explain anything.  Exam averages around 50 to 65.  Just try to do well on one exam and you're set.  Prepare to memorize your butt off for exam 2.  Beware the final project.  Its long","Professor Buttrey clearly knows his thermodynamics backwards and forwards.  He cares a great deal about students, especially if you visit during office hours, and is genuinely excited about what he teaches.  That being said, the class was pretty hard and expect to put in a lot of work in order to get a decent grade.","Buttrey is amazing. Thermo is not an easy class-its not supposed to be. But the homework problems were very applicable and made the tests manageable. He is very helpful if you go see him in office hours. He is a very good professor.","cool","Thermo is a hard class.  Go to office hours if you need help!  Buttrey and the TA's are always willing to help out.  Be prepared to put in a lot of effort, and your grade will probably be lower than you are used to.  There is a curve at the end because exam grades are usually really low.  Beware of the final project!!!","Well intentioned, however his beaming enthusiasm for the subject is somewhat lost in translation during lecture.  Class is tough as nails and homework will take up a fair amount of your week, but exams are for the most part fair.","Hard class, homework takes LONG to do and I think he knows it, but he really wants us to know how to do this stuff.  Pay attention in class but that still might not be enough so be sure to ask TA's for help too.  Sometimes his explanations aren't as easy to understand as the TA's.","Homework load (20-30 hrs if done alone) is ridiculous, the notes and examples are straight from the book if you look hard enough, and the exams average in the 60's, but Buttrey is well versed in the subject and tries his best to impart the necessary knowledge to his students. 231 made my life a living hell, but I still think he's a good professor.","Very bland guy.  Lectures straight from the book, which is a very terrible book.  Tells you to break turbines.  He writes/grades the closed notes portion of the exams, which are harder than the open notes portion.

A lot of his classes are lecture too, so beware. He allows laptop use though, and won't yell at you for sleeping like half of my class does. Relatively easy class, a few papers and his tests are alright. Can get a little confusing about what he wants.","Huisman is an excellent teacher.  He doesn't make you look at millions of Powerpoint slides or anything, he just talks and you just listen. All you have to do to participate in class (part of your grade) is skim through the readings.

This teacher can ramble on for hours, and it is never clear what he wants  the the students to learn.  Stay away from this teacher.  He also talked trash about his other classes, how stupid they were and how he looked into there history to find out why they were stupid.

Great Teacher","Terrific teacher - when he isn't reminding you of how smart he is, or berating your inability at mathematical proofs.

There are many oral presentations and daily homework assignments. ","She is a very nice person! But this was my first semester of Spanish and she was extremely hard to keep up with. She is not clear about assignments, doesn't tell you what to study for on tests, and does not review enough in class. If you're already good at Spanish I'm sure she would be great, not for beginners. ","I don't really know what people are talking about when they say this class is a ton of work. All you really need to do is pay attention in class because we review EVERYTHING we need to know.

She's very enthusiastic and funny and if you're struggling she'll help a lot.","This class is not an easy A, especially for those who think they are ok at Spanish. If you want an A you will have to work hard. At the end of every semester you have to do an oral presentation which requires memorizing a bunch of lines. I would avoid her if you can.

She is willing to help if you ask for it, and almost always provides for extenuating circumstances.  If you do the work, it's an easy A.","Very nice and helpful teacher. She made the class enjoyable. Speaks Spanish throughout the whole class so you have to pay attention. Attend class to understand the material and you will get an easy A. Strongly recommend taking this class with this teacher!","She's a nice lady, and wants to help you.  You need to really work at this class if you want to do well, however. She speaks Spanish throughout most of the class, and it's easy to get lost if you don't pay attention.  You need 96% to get an A, there is little to no extra credit, and none of the 400 points available come without work.","OK Teacher.  Means well.  Gives good overview of Spanish culture and does have passion for language.  Does alot of projection on overhead, but not much sentance structuring in class.  Keep up with class. if you fall behind, your on your own. Final requires a oral exam.... get help on prounciation prior to exam.  It can really hurt your grade if not","bad","She is extremely unclear in everything that is done in class.  I understand spanish very well and I was still never sure of what she wanted. She is a nice person but I would had rather shot myself in the foot then sit in her class for a semester. My advice, do anything to not take her!  If your stuck with her, rate her when your done so others know","She is a very nice lady. She is from Chile, and in this class never talks in english. she wants us to use as much spanish as possible. this class is hard because we read many stories, write papers, and do 3 huge presentations. it isn't really clear all the time what we are supposed to do for homework or due dates of things.","I stink at Spanish, and everybody knows it...even Prof. Hartung, but she worked with me, and made sure my head was above water for the class.

He is a smart guy and is very motivated to educate his students on not only the course info but on making smart investment decisions in life. The pop quizzes are pretty tough if you aren't reading or taking notes in class. Tests aren't bad because he gives a study guide. Optional final.","Funny guy but the class was impossible. No matter how much studying, it always seemed like the most unimportant details from the textbook were put as questions on tests. Final is always optional and replaces your lowest test grade - he says the only way to prepare for the final is by \"reading the entire textbook, it should only take 15 hours\"","Professor Connaughton is a seasoned professional in economics, so he does know what he's talking about, but he goes off topic a lot, which makes it hard to concentrate on what you're supposed to know. Attendance is not mandatory but he gives quizzes once a week that count as 20% of your grade. Don't slack off on the quizzes, they save your grade.","Attendance is not mandatory, but you will fail if you don't go. He gets distracted easily, you get out of class early almost every day but are responsible for self teaching anything he planned to go over but didn't. Lots of quizzes. Overall a tough subject thats very technical and he does good explaining at the begging, stops this after first test.","The class itself is SO boring. The Friday quizzes are crucial so don't miss any to improve your grade! The material you learn in class seems simple, but the tests are ALWAYS completely irrelevant to what we learned in class! Never got above a 70 and I understood the material. There is 4 tests that count for pretty much your whole grade.","Very nice guy and easy to learn from. Doesn't make the class harder than necessary. EASY Quizzes every friday","I took MICRO and passed with a B, Im failing this class. He gets off topic very easily and will not teach you anything but a definition and a graph each time. He does not give homework and your grade relies on just your quizzes you do every friday and the tests. Studying is hard because he gives you questions you have never seen before. BEWARE!","Hes okay, but the class itself sucks, all it is is a bunch of quizzes and test. Yawnnn","Likes to joke around. Lecture is not required.  Fairly nice guy.  DOES NOT SHAKE HANDS!  Must read the book todo well in this class.  Do everything possible to not take the optional final.  The optional final replaces lowest test grade, assuming the final is higher, if the final grade is lower than the lowest test, it STILL COUNTS! BEWARE","Solid choice of professor. You should read the book if you want an A. If you want a B, do the vocab for every test, do well on the weekly (Friday) quizzes to boost your grade, and go to class at least once a week. Not a bad prof, just a little test heavy. Optional final (replaces your lowest grade). 4 tests - 20% each, Quizzes - 20%.","Average professor. Four tests, optional final exam (replaces lowest test grade). Short quiz every Friday. His lectures can be long and boring. Use the practice tests before the exams, he repeats questions. Final exam was easy, mainly previous test and quiz questions!","Awesome lectures, gets off subject regularly but does his best to make econ interesting. Easy exams, read the chapter and make a list of key words and boom you'll make at least a B, understand the underlying concepts by reading before the lecture and you'll make an A.","The worst professor I have ever taken- seriously. He doesnt help, doesn't care, toughest grader, no clear guidelines, no review- all in all, he doesn't prepare the students at all. His lectures are horrible, boring and not even worth it. The tests are very difficult, and in the next class he boasts about how the quarter of the class failed. ","I don't understand how students cannot like this professor. His class is incredibly easy to get an A in. His weekly 6-question quizzes are straight from the text, miss one question and you still have a 100, get them all right a 120. Tests are pretty much quiz questions. Very eager to answer questions in class, not so much out of class.","I personally would not take another class with him. He seemed lazy and disinterested in teaching, but he definitely is well versed in Economics. The tests aren't bad. I went to SI sessions and it helped me a whole lot. I didn't really take notes in class.","He is such a great professor! His lectures are interesting and he clearly knows what he's talking about. He gives extra points on test and quizzes, and he takes some questions straight from the practice exam and the quizzes and puts them on the test. He helps you pass and understand the material! Take him!","Great teacher! Econ was never something I was interested in or understood.  He made it make sense.  His lectures explain the text book so yes you need to read the book.  But if you come to class and read the book you can do well.  His test are composed of quiz questions and practice test questions so you basically have all the test questions.  ","Very nice, honest professor. I don't see why he's getting such negative feedback. Yes, sometimes he can go on tangents and sometimes his humor is a little dated but overall, I enjoyed the class.

Slower to respond to E-mails than I would have preferred (especially for an online class).","Decent amount of work but it is manageable, He has 3 tests and drops one of them, plus a fourth test that you cant drop and is semi-cumulative and all multiple choice, His lectures are interesting and I enjoyed his class.","hes a great guy, teaches the material well, however, there is a workkk load.. i mean work load. hw is due by midnight, he gives u about half a day to a full day to do it. tests are insanelyyyyy hard, even if you study, you will not do as you expect. he does allow you to drop one exam grade usually the lowest. this class felt like a 5 units class.","I would not take this professor.","I would not take him.","The class seemed intimidating at first, but as it went along it was definitely manageable.

","Nice class no complaints.","If you are expecting an instructor that will communicate with you I'd go elsewhere.  He primarily lectures off power points that we aren't allowed  to have (different publisher) so you have no form of studying. Tests are long for amount of time given.

Each test was about 10 chapters and only an hour to finish more than half the class rushed threw it!","Do not take this class hybrid or online! The homework, quizzes and supplements is far more work than in any other class.

She doesn't actually listen to what you say in class. I failed my midterm, but she didn't hand it back to me that day because \"her dog ate it.\" She claimed she'd rewrite it by 5:00, but no, and I ended up dropping the class.

She is all over the place with her teaching technique and information; difficult to follow and random. Grading was very subjective and difficult for students.

She is very enthusiastic and does tend to go off on tangents and is very animated.  I find her more interesting then the more dry professors.

Tests are very fair, not bad.

He is extremely helpful in office hours.","I agree that Dr. Porter would be a phenomenal teacher for the graduate level, but he was for the undergrad level as well. I have had him for 4 classes, and he has always been very well prepared, very interesting, and passionate about the material. If you go to his office hours, he is extremely helpful. I feel he answered student questions clearly.","I have tried two times to tolerate Porter's class and I just can't. He knows his material but gets easily side tracked. He is by no means an orator, and that is quite a problem since all he chooses to do is lecture. I have no problem reading a textbook, but I do have a problem with having my ti,e wasted by useless lectures.","He is a very Smart and nice teacher, but what he doesnt know not everyone is on his level. Porter doesnt answer to his emails. You have to call him. And if you got an F on  your first exam, make sure its all Cs, Bs, or As on the other exams or you will fail the course. If i had to take one of his courses again, it would be in the summer.","Porter is not as bad as everyone says. It is important to read the book, I found outlining it the best tool. He only takes your best 3 of 4 tests which is really nice. As long as you study the book's definitions and understand it, the tests are not that difficult. He is a very smart guy and has a lot of knowledge","Everyone needs to lighten up on criticizing Dr. Porter with these reviews.  You need to read your textbook to do well in the class.  This should not be a surprise or an unnecessary effort on anyone's part.  His lectures are very straight forward and interesting if you pay attention!  He even tells what sections to look over for the essays? c'mon","had him for 254 and 362, i think he was going through a rough time last year. probably the most interesting professor at WCU. his mind is like an encyclopedia, and lectures are fascinating. 254 tested super easy; 362 not so much. he doesn't coddle students, and he shouldn't.","Perhaps the best teaching prof I have ever had (and I've attended some name universities like Lehigh, Wisconsin, UConn). Shows up absolutely prepared, knows his material inside-out, very thorough explanations. Had him for psy 100 and 362, he is excellent in both.  Exams can be tough, so do the reading.","very hard and very boring","Louis is a nice guy, but you can't understand him at all. Skip class and read the chapters a few times. Show up to class on test days and get an easy A. The test questions are based off of definitions in the text and highlighted experiments. Drops the lowest of 4 grades...easiest A I've ever earned! (THIS ONLY GOES FOR PSY254. OTHERS ARE HARD!)","This class is nearly impossible if you aren't dedicated to reading the book like it's your Bible. The book is a necessary and the chapters are unbearably in depth. Exams are essay and test you on  actually fully retaining information way too much information at once. Try hardest to avoid this professor for this class.","This course, with Dr. Porter is not for the slacker. If your looking for an easy A, and a walk through course...This is not the course for you. He is very serious about the material he presents, and does so in a manner that can be intimating if your not well versed in the concepts and material. He suggest reading the text before lecture. Great idea","Despite what everyone says about him, I think he is a great professor. Yeah he stutters, but if you're not shallow you'll manage. He's really smart and you're going to actually have to do work so suck it up.","By far the worst psych professor at WCU. Whatever you do, don't take this class with him!!! I get A's in all my classes, and I had to drop this one, because he just makes it impossible!! Take Gans or Verrekia instead","agreed...impossible to follow his lectures when hes NEVER not making noise. if he's not speaking, hes saying \"ayeeeeeeee uhhh\". class will just confuse yoy, it is however incredibly EASY to learn if you read the book. The book explains it really well, and provides all info needed for tests. nice guy, terrible prof! easy class if you just read","Despite what everyone else says, hes a nice guy. The class wasn't really all that bad either, you just have to know the book inside and out.","only the best 3 out of 4 tests count for your final grade. Don't go to class, it really is a waste of your time. An A is very possible with self-determination.","His lectures are extremely boring; I practically fall asleep every time I go. There are 4 60-question multiple choice tests, and he drops the lowest grade. He also does not count attendance towards your grade. Do yourself a favor: just stay home and read.","pretty much tought myself everything the entire semester. don't even bother going to class, you can't understand a word of his lectures. does not explain anything, hardly even demonstrated anything on the board, and it was math! easy tests though.","Horrible Professor. He is so hard to understand and listen to  He is not helpful at all and if you ask for help he gets very defensive.

I've taken him for Digital II, electromechanical systems, Programmable logic controllers, and fundamentals of robotics. Very easy-going, teaches clearly, and if you pay attention the quizzes and tests will be the easiest you'll ever take.","One of the most disrespectful, arrogant, and pompous instructors you could ever come across. Flies through the coursework, gets aggravated so easily and really treats students with a voice of an opinion. Take him only if you enjoy having a militant clown that takes pride in getting under everyone's skin while condescending to the class.","Good professor but lack the ability to understand his students. If you are not a fast learner and willing to research some of what he said outside the class-room you will be left behind. He gives very good reviews for mid final and final.","He's a good teacher, although I think this particular course needs  one textbook from which most of it is based off of, as opposed to power points and pdfs. I don't think that is his fault, though, and more of an issue with the quality of the EET degree program as a whole.","I thought this class was challenging, and I learned a lot from it. If you are looking for an easy A without learning anything, don't pick this professor. He cares about making sure his students learn. I disagree with the comments below. He is one of the better professors in the EET/CET degree programs.","Is under the impression that everyone in his class is there to get a Masters in Electrical Engineering when in reality 90% of the class are CET majors who couldnt care less about the subject matter.  This class is useless if your on the CET Microsoft path but it is a requirement, suck it up and find a different professor.","Very good instructor.

Mr. Andrews will spend one on one time with you and the lab techs are great too!","The worst professor I've ever come across.

He teaches his intro class ass if you should already know everything.  He's garbage and is arrogant.  This guy sucks!","Digital II. This guy is very arrogant. He made the class very difficult and could care less for the student. Dropped before an F and retake with J. Carstensen. Made an A and understood the class, Man how a Poor Prof can mess you up. Do yourself a favor Take Carstensen for Digital II, He trains you in real world industry language.","The professor expects wayyyy too much. He is very difficult to get ahold of, and goes a bit too fast during his lectures. I was truely afraid to ask questions. BUT, if you do all your homework, labs, and well on the midterm/final, you can easily get a B in Digital Systems I.\r Cheers!","If you want to learn how to be errogant and be treated less than human then this is the professor for you.  Don't expect to contact this professor because he is not available.  You will find yourself not even participating in class because he just shoot you down.

No group work, online quizzes, papers and tests. Looks like any other professor.","Peter is a real cool guy, and a great professor. He is very passionate about what he teaches and will try relentlessly to get you to enjoy it as well. Although sometimes going on large tangents into stuff he finds interesting but really isn't related to the course directly he can sometimes cloud what is important to know (or not).","I love Dr. O'Brien so much.

Makes understanding complicated stories very simple by going over everything in thorough detail. Gives fair time for all assignments. Favorite prof at Dalhousie. Spectacular","Absolutely brilliant.","I really enjoyed his class. He obviously loved the material and it really showed in his lectures. Sometimes lectures were hard to follow because the only visual aids we had were a slideshow of images. His tests are very image/date/term based, so focus on that. They are geared towards giving you the opportunity to show everything you know!","he's a total greek-speaking dreamboat","i got good notes from his lectures, but when i went to see him he was a lot less personable.. decent class but got pretty confusing about what they really wanted from the assignments","Too much to say in such a limited space.","I loved Dr. O'Brien! He often got off-topic but he was very passionate about his stuff. Incredibly fair, his tests always had options for questions, and if you attended the classes you knew the stuff well.

Class structure: 10 mins of looking at the calendar, 30 mins repeating the last lecture, 10 mins maybe getting to something new.

Be prepared to memorize each minor detail of every piece of content in this class and explain in depth during tests.","A statistics course with almost no mathematical or visual aids, just audio lectures and text on a slide.

The exams were worded open-endedly yet you got no marks if you didn't say the exact things he wanted. Also, bad textbook.","Fabrigar enjoys lecturing and joking around, and can make the studies seem interesting.

Totally inconsequential details were tested while major concepts were not, and the multiple choice questions were confusingly written to trip you up Nice guy but went off on tangents too much","There isn't a lot of material, so Fabrigar expects you to know the slides in detail. This made the midterm pretty difficult for most people, but if you know that's what he wants, you'll do well on the exams.

Students who don't go to class will fail.   Excellent help in office hours, go.  Actually a sweetheart but takes no BS.","The topics covered are simple,  but she made the tests hard through unfairly harsh grading and time constraints,  and she was pretty unapologetic about it.  The class was unbearably boring  and not worth attending.","An excellent researcher I'm sure. I wish universities cared a bit more about teaching ability though. ","Spends at least half an hour of every lecture repeating the last lecture; drags out the very simple examples and speeds through the complicated ones. Grades for the final project were never published. Average on every quiztest seemed to hover around 60 (with no curve). ","Difficult to understand and learn from. Clearly excellent in her area, but subsequently has a poor grasp on what needs to be explained in detail and what doesn't. This problem could have been fixed by more student input. Midterm average was a 60 (never curved) and that was apparently the entire class's fault for not coming to her for help.","She is an absolutely fantastic teacher. The best I've had in the department, grad or undergrad. Her lectures are clear and she explains everything well.","Maybe she is a good researcher, but she is definitely not a good teacher.If you want to learn some theories you may choose her, if you want to gain some techniques, then you make a huge mistake for choosing her class.","Homeworks, quiz, mid-term exam, paper reading(10 papers), paper review(10), presentation(one and a half class/person), project, final exam, project presentation. She never lose a thing right? If you choose her course, good luck!","She seems do not like giving lectures. half of the semester was reading papers. You may think it is OK, but actually you need even more time to understand those hard papers, you have to write paper review for each paper, you have to do a big project  based on one of the papers. The final exam was not about the lectures but about the papers. Useless","Teaching a little in the class, lecture usually ended after the mid exam and then she ask students to read a lot of hard useless papers ,write all the reviews, give a 45m presentation about one of the paper and finish a big project based on one of the paper. Remember all of these must be finished in one month. The final exam is unreasonable.","Put notes up at the beginning of semester but stopped because students used them.  Class was disinterested because material was uninteresting and inapplicable as taught (although DBs are useful, it is better to pick up a SQL book and teach yourself).","Ridiculously hard exams.  No longer has notes put up because she thinks that it helps the students?  She really hates students that don't go to class.  Assumes people care about databases.  We don't - it's a required CS course.","I'm pretty sure I died a couple times of boredom in this class.  Makes some things more difficult than they need to be.  Sometimes it seemed like we had gone over the same thing for a month.  Has students put notes online, so don't go to class (unless you're the one taking notes that day of course).","She's a really good teacher.

He's a friendly, funny man. Gave a difficult second test this semester, with only 2 pages and questions which a few math majors were shocked to see given to us. Overall, not bad.

Personally, Kremer is an amazing man.","It's a relaxed class but if you really love philosophy, it might not be a great experience because he really dulls the subject down","Kremer: boring and confused & LOVES his Catholic god--will mention \"God\" every lecture and for the entire lecture.

Essays were short and straight-forward. Bird course.","Greatest prof ever.  The course has been easy and interesting. He started off with the basics and then went on with the main subjects while providing good explanations and examples.  Marking was VERY fair, great TAs (very helpful for essays), well-organized course webpage with good notes and study questions, good introductory notes in the reader, very approachable in office hours... I strongly recommend his course to those with no background in philosophy like me.  This is by far the BEST COURSE I've had at U of T.","He was very kind and cared about students. He kept an eye on the TA's and what marks they were giving us, which is good. He was great.","teaches in a slow and steady pace... so u can take ur time to understand wht he's saying & easy to understand ....","Great professor.  He throws in these old cheezy jokes for fun, but they only add to his charisma.  He is able to explain the material clearly, and usually gives two examples for every point - to some this sounds repetitive, but it works for me and many others.  he has personally helped me with course material questions over lunch, great guy.","Kremer is knowledgable, but the class is boring. on the bright side, course notes are onling so you can afford to miss class. Play loud music in your head to stay awake. \r P.S. Being a nice guy doesn't make you a good prof. (Or did you guys miss the logic section???)","Wow. Students calling a prof an idiot? Right.  Prof. Kremer has been teaching this subject longer than most of us have been alive (he taught my Dad!) so he knows what he's talking about!! He may get lost in his thoughts at times, but he's a very smart person.  He speaks to us as an intellectual, not a spoon-feeding highschool teacher!","All these comments are crap.  The truth is that if you aren't majoring or doing a spec. in philosophy then of course you're going to be bored in an introductory philosophy class whether kremer is teaching it or not.

For labs, there is a report due every week, and if it is not satisfactory to him he gives you an R to redo it, so you have two labs due the next week.  Not very nice either.

Got only D in my life!","He mostly expects you to come to class with knowledge of the material.Instead of going over material that the class didn't know he'll just lecture why you should've known it.

The book we used was worthless, I tended to go with his lectures instead since he makes more sense.","Professor is not an easy professor, but he's also not unfair.

Everyone who failed his class most likely didn't pay attention in class because when I had him he was very clear with his lectures...and I mean very.

Gave pop quizzes every friday on stuff he did not cover. talked about nothing that had anything to do with class. had to withdraw.","I had Pribula for Gen Chem 131 lab and he was HORRIBLE!!!!

I would recommend not taking the class and just reading the book.","Currently enrolled in PD 9. After introductions were made and why we took this class I felt I was in a support group were no one wants to talk. Class is 7 weeks long and only and hour and ten minutes. Spends most time taking roll and providing workshop information that Sierra has to offer for extra credit. Lectures are short,and not to the point.","Easy A but one of the weirdest teachers I have ever taken! She like to make the class meditate to relax, but she really gets into it! SHE STARTED MOANING DOING MEDITATION! Im glad this class was only a half of a semester!","Easy A but a waste of time for the most part.

You will learn a lot by her good example.  Especially if you are shy and need to learn to be assertive....this is the class for you.  Wish she taught other classes.","Probably the easiest A you will get. She grades just on attendance and if you turn the (2) assignments in on time.

Very helpful during office hours and replies to emails quickly. You need to study for this class in order to get an A.","A true gem!! He explains everything clearly in a step-by-step way. Made a complicated subject much easier to understand. Very nice and funny guy too. I hope he doesn't retire soon. Homework can take a long time, but he gives great hints if you come to office hour. Exams are much easier than the HW. Literally just apply yourself and you'll be fine.","The way he teaches the course is honestly a disgrace to the department and the school in it's entirety. If you're ready to cry a lot over the tons of assignments and super heavy exams with little to no relevant guidance from the professor then go for it. I suggest you try your hardest to find a prof who actually cares about teaching the course.","With out a doubt the worst computer science professor I have had at eastbay. I was able to identify several incorrect statements in reference to state machines. When I presented my work to him and proved I was right my grade began to suffer even though my work was correct and matched other students work. This is a terrible education I received.","This teacher is one of the better teachers here at CSUEB. He writes things on the board and explains things clearly. Exams are easier than homework but he is not so nice on partial credit, so do try to get the exact correct answer. He also smiles when he talks, and no, not in a good way. I think he is slightly crazy. I'm not kidding.","8 assignments, 1 midterm, 1 final. Students grades were different based on similar answers but ill leave that aside. I would not recommend this professor if you have trouble deciphering other people's hand writing. If you do choose him best of luck you will need it.","There were 8 assignments, 1 midterm, and 1 final. If you understand the assignments, you should do well on the midterm/final. He tends to go through things fast during lecture, and his handwriting can be unclear. However, his grading criteria is fair. Complete the assignments on time and review them before the midterm/final, and you should be good.","1 midterm 1 final and 8 assignments.

Down to the itty grittys He tries his best but his lectures are hard to follow. His writing is very difficult to follow. He doesnt explain things well. Will answer questions but doesnt offer much explanation if you can take another class you should its not easy and you may not learn much.","Lectures are well organized, clear, interesting and lot of topics were covered, hence take away from this course was hands full. He is very skilled and clarifies doubts patiently. Assignments will be a mix of easy, difficult, challenging and tricky questions. But, Mid-term and Final exams are fairly easy. ","I think Dr.Johnson is one of the best professors at CSUEB. His lectures always stayed on topic, his examples were clear and useful, he gave precise expectations on all assignments, and graded consistently and fairly.

He really tried his best to make the class as stress-free as possible due to COVID. For lecture tests, you literally just need to memorize his ppts word for word. For manuscripts, you have to read a lot of papers and he grades them very harshly but you just deal with it. Did well only because of hard work.","Incredibly arrogant and obnoxious. You would think he would be more accommodating due to COVID-19, but Dr. Seagull prides himself on being overbearing. I don't understand why he chooses to be so hard on his students, but I understand that some professors expect excellence. However, there is no need to be rude and condescending to your students.","It's not like you won't get better at the class, it's just that you'll suffer at the very beginning. He'll give you an assignment, describe how to do it, and read what you did. If you're lucky, you'll get a C. Fix his corrections, maybe a B-. He grades you not on your improvement, but simply on your ability to do it (even if it's your first time).","Definitely regret taking him for bio15. He does not teach and expects you to know how to write a manuscript and then gives a bad grade because you didnt know that it had to be done that way. He definitely knows what hes talking about but does not convey that much until after you receive the grade for an assignment. Avoid if you can","Hes a good professor. Took him for plant biology. Straight forward and I enjoyed his class a lot. I did very well in his class and worked hard for my grade. Sadly, when I asked for a recommendation for grad school, he told me besides my good grade he doesnt know me. Good teacher but doesnt go the extra mile to help you after graduation.","Seagull is a great guy but can see right through you if you're lazy. You can't be a bio major (or a doctor) if you're not willing to work and Seagull will teach you how to do that. Tests are super easy, no application all memorizing. Lab reports are rough but if you spend time on them youll do ok. When you're a senior youll be glad u took him.","Pretty straight forward class. Just memorize the material on the powerpoint and you'll be set. WIll often tell you which specific question will be on the test, and anything that's in list form will probably be on the test. Harsh lab report grader, and nit-picks everything on it, but it's for the better. Really funny, sarcastic, and really savage.","No. Just no. One of the worst teachers  I've ever had. Necessarily harsh grader, not willing to listen, and not very helpful in office hours. He is kind of funny though. I would say don't take him, but he's the only one that teaches the course.","He will test on what he says in class along with his powerpoints. Lab reports are difficult. He's a very tough grader on both lab reports and tests. Offers one make-up exam, final was basically all material on past tests.","You could do your best and put all your effort in all the work you hand in. Doesn't matter. The lab manual has too many spelling mistakes to count but your work better be greater then life if you even consider trying to get an A. This class is more difficult than performing surgery. I dare any teacher to take his class and TRY to pass. STAY AWAY.","Must memorize lectures for his exams, which are short answer. He gives partial credit, but beware he has a stamp that says \"Does Not Answer Question\". He recycles questions from the exams for the final. Hates it when people walk in late to class.","Harsh grader and can be very condescending to students. He often instructed us to do an assignment a certain way, and then switched what he wanted without telling us, blamed us for it, and took points off. He also expects us to know everything, and gives us an attitude when we ask questions. I would NOT recommend him.","This class solely depends on how well you are at memorizing. There's basically no learning involved because you just need to know his powerpoint lectures by heart and regurgitate them on his short-answers exams. Good luck!!","He expects you to memorize the power points and spit back all the information on his lecture exams. I was not able to pass a single exam in this class because he grades very harshly. He doesn't take attendance, but starts promptly at 7:55 am. Memorize all the notes in DETAIL and you might do fine. I do not recommend him as a professor.","Dr. Seagull is a good professor and he knows what he's talking about. if you ask for help he's there but he's an extremely tough grader. Most people don't like him because he is sort of rude and condescending but i kind of like him. Bio majors have no way around taking him, he's the only bio 13 professor.","He's is an EXTREMELY harsh grader!!!!! He is very picky about everything and grades as if you should know how to write lab reports perfectly. In class he is very helpful but otherwise he isn't of much help. I wouldn't recommend him!","Professor seagull had us take 3 tests and a final, and my lab was with his assistant and we had 3 lab reports, and lab quizzes. He pretty much takes the questions out of the slides for the test, so memorization is key. Definitely easier to get an A here than say bio 11. Lectures are good, never really got bored. Study and you should be fine.","Not one of the better professors I've had, but is still decent. Pretty strict, and doesn't really seem to have any interest in the students. Emphasizes rote memorization, which kinda sucks. I always phased out halfway through his lectures. He can be pretty helpful outside the classroom, though. Just takes a while to get used to.","Just no. Just no. He likes to contradict himself and say \"I taught this in detail\" and expect you to know absolutely every single aspect of effing plants for the tests even if he didn't teach it. Or he teaches one thing in class and you put it on the test and he marks it wrong. Tests are all essay. So have fun.","Dr Seagull was the best teacher I have had at Hofstra.

Her grading was inconsistent and unclear, and she took herself too seriously. If you are an art major, take it with her, you will learn what you are in for and how to do basic and not fun stuff. If not an art major you will spend hours for nothing more than a distribution requirement.","I have Bevin for Foundations. The class is very technique and theory intensive, and you complete a lot of projects. But she is always available to help, even if you ask the same question a million times. You will also improve in your understanding of both art theory and technique by then end of the semester.","Bevin's expectations of an introductory art class were completely unrealistic. She gave us too little time to finish the assignments and she expected them to be very detailed. I spent 3 times more time for this class than any of my other classes. If you are going to take intro studio art take it with another professor.","Bevin's assignments were a lot of work, but rarely allowed for any creativity.  She graded harshly according to her own personal preferences, and seemed very condescending in class.  She definitely picks favorites.  If you have a choice at all, I would advise taking another professor for AR131.","Bevin makes her students jump through a lot of hoops, especially in foundations. Some of her assignments take all the pleasure out of art making. On the other hand, when I left Colby, I had lots of tools in my artist's tool belt. Bevin's insistence on color mastery is her best attribute. You will learn a lot about painting, even if it kills you.","Bevin is a very capable artist and professor, and she will make you do your work.  That being said, I found her quite biased toward specific styles of art and particular students.  In a subjective dpt such as art, it felt impossible to ever please her.  The only time I got an A was when I took a course pass/fail.  She did nothing as my advisor.","If you want to take Art just to \"explore\" or try something new, do not take Engman. She gives TONS of work, so much that during finals week I spent my life in the art studio and almost camped there an entire night (no kidding- I've spent many nights without sleep working on her art portfolio). However, she's very nice, and extremely helpful.","I graduated in '99 and I still use things Professor Engmen taught me.  For example, I'm still driven by what she said to me one day; \"Invention is what you should strive for, never let invention become convention\".  I constantly use that in my artistic world but also in the business world where I work.  Thank you Bevin.","This course is very demanding and difficult if you get Bevin. Be prepared to spend hours on end in the studio perfecting your artwork. Bevin is a stickler for detail and will always give an honest and professional opinion about your work. Don't take this course if you are just out to fulfill the requirement.","while bevin is good at explaining things clearly, i would not take foundations with her. at least in the intro course, she clearly plays favorites, and is one of the more difficult professors for the course.  i'm very outgoing, but she still didn't know my name at the end of the course. at colby, that's just about unforgivable.","bevin is amazing if you are an ART MAJOR. too many people think that studio art will be an easy A and a way to get rid of your arts requirement. if you are an art major you will find bevin to be one of the most knowlegeable, helpful professors in the whole department. and she's incredibly nice.","No Comments","No Comments","Bevin is the best professor at Colby!!!

She reads word for word off of the powerpoints but doesn't explain what she is talking about. Weekly case studies that either came straight out of the book or you weren't taught the information needed to answer the questions. 40 hours of volunteer work required and a big final portfolio.","Professor Spolsky was extremely nice and knowledgable.  For my class, there is a required 40 hours of community service, a presentation/slideshow, an interview with a social worker, and a paper (5-8 pgs.).

She may not respond to your emails, but she will assist you with anything you need help with. Just make sure to bring it up to her before or after class. There isn't many tests, three for our class.

ATTENDANCE IS NOT MANDATORY, AS YOUR GRADE WILL BE MADE UP OF HALF MIDTERM HALF FINAL &AN OPTION TO DO A PRESENTATION TO OPT OUT OF ONE EXAM. TAKE NOTES AS THE EXAM IS EXACTLY THAT.","GPA Killer. Awful Professor. He gives everyone a B no matter what you do. I got an A on all of his exams and likely got an A on the presentation (doesn't matter considering he drops the lowest grade), and still received a B in the class. Meanwhile a girl got 3 D's on tests and still got a B. Do Not Take!","I came to class once every other week and got a 55 on the midterm, did not take the final, and did my presentation a few minutes before class and my grade was a B-.

Just 2 exams & 1 presentation","Even if you were the worlds expert in economics you would get a bad grade. Only 3 questions on the 3 exams, and he grades them as he prefers, subjectively. This class will bring your GPA down and is not worth taking in any sense. Doesn't follow the book and exam is not bases on lectures. If you take this class you will regret it.","I took this guy way back in Fall 1998 as a SJU undergrad freshman for Microeconomics. He was horrible then and judging by reviews now, nothing changed. He is very confusing and nothing in class is clear. Try to avoid this guy and take another professor if possible. If Gary Mongiovi teaches macro or micro economics, then take him!","I too, thought people were just being harsh in their reviews. Being in class is only important to find out when the test is. Otherwise, you're on your own. Sit in the back and cheat. It's so easy since he sleeps through he exam, and quite frankly the only way to pass. I sat in the front row and took my test with my notebook so that I didn't fail","Worst Professor I've ever taken at SJU.  If you want your GPA ruined take this guy because he is the absolute worst! He'll scribble charts on the board all day long and never explain what anything means than expect you to comprehend it on a test!  He's Horrible!","DONT TAKE HIM!!","Worst professor I have ever had at St.John's!   The material isn't that complicated but his methods of teaching are terrible. His book recommendation has a copyright date of 1993 (google is your best source of info). midterm - 3?s, final and oral presentation but you never find out your grade for the final or presentation until grades are released.","There is NO point in taking this man's class! I'm an Econ major and has had him for 2 classes and almost three now! FORTUNATELY! I WAS ABLE TO TAKE ANOTHER CLASS! Anyway this man goes around in circles during class, and he's never prepared!

Her lectures are irrelevant to what we are supposed to be learning. \"Optional assignments\" are not really optional because you must do them to get a decent grade. Makes you read the textbook word for word because quizzes are hard and do not test you so much on important concepts, just random facts.","Really nice lady, but if you want to succeed you really need to stay on top of all \"optional\" coursework. Attendance went from 45 to 8-10 regular students due to the dull-ish lectures and excessive in class and projects/homework, all of which are not mandatory. Grades by points, so if not enough assignments are completed, it reflects on final grade","I would not recommend taking class with her. During class she talks on and on about things that aren't relevant to whatever we're \"supposed\" to be studying. Honestly don't think I learned anything from her class. Her grading system makes it almost impossible to get an A unless you do every single optional assignment that she gives.","Long winded lectures about nothing relevant. Never really updated on grades until it's far too late. Ridiculous amount of busy work with no clear learning objectives, in fact I have no idea at what point we were supposed to learn something. I still don't know how well I did on any of the work I've done. Rethinking a journalism major.","I did not enjoy her class at all it was very project heavy. She always said nothing was mandatory but in order to pass you needed to turn in at least 7 projects. Also to do well in the class stay up to date on current events. Don't take this class","2 quizzes a day, one at the beginning and one at the end. Not only would she ramble for the entire 3 hour class about nothing relevant to the curriculum, but she would hold us in longer to take the final quiz. Homework and grading system is very unclear. Doesn't update you about your grade until it's too late. overall bad time","If you're a communications major and must take the mass comm 100 and 101 do not take this professor. She will just talk through the whole class about unrelated things. Beware of long quizzes to be taken in a short amount of time.","She's unclear in her teaching and takes a while to give projects back. The class is heavily based on current events and projects. She also assumes that the people in the class are journalism/ communications majors. I would not take her again.","Professor O'Neil is a great professor you just have to show up ON TIME, read the required readings, do your homework and establish a relationship with her. She is a tough grader but she is only trying to help you reach your maximum potential. You have to keep up with the media and if you plan on becoming a journalist then truly devote yourself.","Do not buy the textbook! You can go to the library and read the section for the week. She is very stubborn and does not really stay on topic. The class is based on a point system  which makes it harder. She is also unorganized and hands back a lot of papers which gets confusing. Field trips are mandatory if you want to pass.","As a comm major, by far one of the hardest class I have taken. The reading material is interesting, but the dates stuff are due are confusing! Do extra credit and keep up with the news!!!","She isn't as bad as most people say. Just do your work and you will easily pass. Plenty of opportunities for points. Book is not needed. Test and quiz don't matter. Just don't be lazy and the class is actually easy. The assignments are pretty interesting. No negative points in the class which is cool so if you fail tests/quiz it won't hurt you.","To pass with a good gra you have to do a lot of homework. There are also a lot of tests. Attendance is mandatory. She is fair with her grading and expectations. She will make you work for your grade. It helps if you read the newspaper and keep up with current events. The book is a necessity if you can't afford it they have a copy in the library.","She never stops talking, I wish that were hyperbole but it sums her up the best. Clearly she knows a lot about communications, but this class felt like sitting in a classroom listening to an audiotextbook for 90min. At least her PR class had a few group work days, this was nothing but pure lecture drudgery from day one. Easy to amass points though.","Yes, she can be a little scattered at times but it's quite easy to get her back on track. Really cares about her students. Feedback on your stories are amazing, will definitely be a valuable source to improving your writing. Can be combative on matters she is passionate about. Always remember that your EIC has final say on all your stories.","O'Neil is a mixed bag, she's obviously passionate about news and tries to impart the practice of being aware to her students but she can forget a bit about the clock. There was many a time where she wouldn't have time to give us quizzes she said we should be prepared for. Overall though she's fair and if you keep on top of things you'll do well.","She falls behind on grading very quickly. You will go pretty much the whole semester not knowing what your grade is. You'll ask yourself \"What's the point?\" for a lot of the  work she assigns. She goes off on tangents a lot. She is very passionate of journalism and communications overall but it is hard to enjoy her class.","For someone who is a prof of journalism, she seems to lack a grasp of how news is reported in the modern day. Woefully unaware of new tech. She also seems to forget language about race and gender that is not cool with AP Stylebook. Take another prof or change your major. ","Can't stay on topic, takes nearly an hour to go through her prompt and tests don't mean a thing. Expect offensive language that only a babyboomer would make about race and gender. Take another professor instead and if you can't, then change your major or wait until you can take another prof.","She gets off topic all the time. There were many meetings where she gave us a history lesson. She talks a lot about her family. If the 200 question final were based on history and her family, i would have totally passed.

I wouldn't recommend having him for a class you weren't committed to. That would be painful.","He is tough but he is a great professor! He isn't a typical robot drone only reading from the text, he actually teaches making very interesting lectures. Bottom line: he is a great professor.","Unpleasant, Condescending, and his classes are painful. 2 days prior to the midterm no one had any idea what to expect, as he does not post his notes online and does not explain concepts clearly. He is the dept. head at Memorial, so good luck complaining.","He speaks very slow and clearly, overall he knows his stuff and there is no doubt in that. However, he is not easy to approach for help. The way he lectures makes some of the most simple concepts seem hard! Environment of class is intimidating. He likes class participation. Want a challenge, he's the prof. for you.","Very stuck up man. Made a seemingly easy-to-grasp subject very difficult for me. Will NOT put notes online stating he knows that no one would show up for his class if he did, and doesn't give time to take notes during lectures.Asks questions and shuts down those who answer, then becomes frustrated when nonone does. Read the text, he won't help you.","Overall he is not a very good prof. He does not know or care to know the name of a single student in his class and he is rude a times if you ask a question. He does not give students a chance to write down notes from his slides and he refuses to put his notes online. He can be funny at times but he is not a good prof for a first year course.","In the one class I had with Dr. Tate, he did not take the time to get to know or even learn the names of his students. To me, he didn't put in the effort he expected from his students. If you're going to be lazy, what incentive is that to participate in your class?","he is funny","I don't know how anyone could find his lectures confusing or boring.  He talks slow to give everyone a chance to write what he says.  He is so clear, in fact, you don't even need to read the text books.  Great prof.","Love this prof. He's is my favorite by far. I guess I'll agree that he is kind of slow and quiet, but I've rarely found his classes boring. I don't think he's difficult to approach or talk to. He is funny and sarcastic but he knows his stuff. He grades fairly and he's just an over all great prof.","oh my lordy dyin'...he seems nice enough but he sounds like a slowed down tape recorder. I don't know where he's from.. certainly not Newfoundland.. no offense but he sounds like eeyore... he talks SO SLOW","He talks so slow and repeats everything like five times, and it's pretty much word for word from the text.  You need to be good at taking your own notes because he doesn't really write much on the board, only the main headings that he talks about.  Very easy course if you pay attention in class and read your text once before exams.","I was bored to tears with this class. The material is fine, and I love the book, but the professor is just really dry and boring. The notes are all over the place, but that you can always find everything in the book.","He knows what he is doing but the notes are all over the place on the board","Tate is the reason for your existence. Don't be insulted, be humbled. Go to class, because the concepts take a while to tease out fully - that's the reason for the seemingly \"slow\" pace. You think you know what Malinowski was REALLY trying to tell us? Think AGAIN! You'll stumble over it in the Breezeway if you haven't gone to lectures! Go to class.","Fairly arrogent, but thats only if you ask him a stupid question. Boring lectures though, you can miss a class and come back and he will still be going over the same stuff.","Overall, the class was interesting.  I enjoyed the way that the professor lectured.

Sometimes his lectures got a little bit boring, but he was very helpful and knowledgeable. An above average teacher for an entry level PoliSci class.","HE understands what's going on. I am not sure if the same can be said for anyone else in the class.","This class is extremely well organized. All the course material was included in the course pack and posted on the website, so the text book was pretty much optional. The material is a little dry (read: extremely boring), but he has a sense of humor about some things.","He is a nice guy and can be very helpful if you don't understand. He posts all of the material online so going to class isn't always necessary. Listening to him is difficult at times, he pauses and says umm a lot but he knows the material that he teaches. His grading style is strange but helpful.","Professor is a senior citizen but very smart, a Harvard graduate.  He has an interesting grading scheme which can seem fair.  The course is broken down into 3 multiple-choice exams, 2 take-home writing assignments, and a final.  His rule is that if your final grade is higher than your average, your final exam grade will be your final letter-grade.","it's true he can be boring espeacially as I had him at 9 in the morning but he was very knowledgable and more than fair in his grading. if you listen to him you may find yourself interested. it's also not really neccessary to go to all his classes since he posts his material verbatim online","Though he can be boring (and risk of falling asleep is high), he really knows what he is talking about. He makes the material super clear. He's really smart, and he has an interesting accent to boot. For a 100 class, he was good, but I would expect in an upper-level class he's be more interesting if he had more class participation.","While Dr. Miller can be very dry, and dare I say boring, he is clearly an expert in the field and has a wealth of knowledge to share.  Fortunately everything was on power point so you could look at information at your own leasure.  In class exams were structured simply, but he can be very particular in what he is looking for.  I highly recommend.","i hate his voice...puts me right to sleep... class is not too hard every frickin thing is on the powerpoints!!!! but he is way too anal about your answers in the bluebook--take home portion is much easier but still a bad grader besides that he was very nice and made an effort to help although it wasnt much help.

In actuality, nothing close to that. Day is biased, nonsensical, and much more caught up in trying to sound \"too intelligent for thou\" than actually teach. avoid at all costs","My experience with this prof has been absolutely awful. Definitely the worst class I have taken in my entire life. In the class, he expected us to follow completely nonsensical speech. Outside the class, he was completely unhelpful and often rude.","I just saw him on a Youtube clip and I just have to say that he exemplifies the problems of Canadian academia.

Then, if you have time, try the most difficult(3 dots) problems. Go to the library or someplace quiet and work the hw problems on paper because you remember more information.

Whenever I had trouble, Wagh was there to help! I feel like he wants everyone to get an A in his class!","Wagh is the man. Thick Indian accent that may confuse you if you're ESL, but I had no problem understanding him. Do not skip class; if you miss even one, you're boned, especially for the unit on 8085 assembly. The ASM programs can get monstrous, so pay attention. Oh, and don't halt the processor... never EVER halt the processor... very very bad.","One of the best professors ever! Extremely helpful in office hours. He's very respectful to students. Gives easy assignments and exams. Take his courses whenever possible.","I adore Professor Wagh! He's definitely one of my favorite professors so far at Lehigh. Yes, some parts of the class are hard (assembly!), but not unreasonably so. He is probably the kindest, sweetest, gentlest old man on earth. He will spend hours helping you with problems if you need it. He's very funny too! Makes the material quite interesting.","Skip class and you're finished. Material is hard, tests are even harder. He is a very strict grader.

A must-take professor.","I've taken 2 writing classes with Phil Deaver. He's very enthusiastic about writing and he really knows his stuff.

He leaves it up to you but keeps you informed of what the plan is. We didn't use the book much for this, because the writing took over.

We used the text book probably 3 or so times, not sure if it was worth picking up. If you're not concerned with grading, he's fine. If you are, you'll have some trouble adjusting to not knowing where you stand grade wise.","If you love to hear the same pointless story over and over again then Deaver's the teacher for you. He's completely disorganized, snappy when you ask for help, and he'll fail you if you question his grading. His class is easy, so long as you don't care about learning or becoming a better writter.

He is also an excellent writer and always willing to help his students.  I would definitly take one of his classes again.","Deaver is so cool.

One of the sweetest most knowledgeable professors I have ever had. ","Best Professor at Baruch so far !!!!!","This is by far the easiest class you can take. Midterm & Final 50% each literally exactly from his notes. He won't post them on blackboard so take pictures or write everything down. He makes the law really easy to understand especially if you enjoy political science. Don't hesitate to take him if you're looking for a GPA Boost.","Loved this professor!! The way he taught/presented his lectures made it so easy to remember the material. Only two exams (midterm & final, each 50% of your grade). You don't need to purchase the textbook, his lecture notes are all you need to study for the exams. If you put in the effort to study for his tests, this course is an  easy A.","Prof. Singer is amazing. Very knowledgeable, experienced and funny. I actually enjoyed his evening class.

His test are super easy.  If you copy and study the notes there's no way you can get lower than a 90. He has a pretty good sense of humor, which comes in handy during the lecture and when briefing cases. Recommended 1000%","Funny guy.  Somewhat slanted in his views so take it all with a grain of salt.  but he tries to be entertaining. Two exams; midterm and final.  That's it. So each is 50% of your grade.

Doesn't assign reading, but you better know your cases & vocab REALLY WELL.","I had to look up his name to write this review because I forgot it, and I still received an A.  That's how easy he is.  Just write down the notes he has in class.  Know what's in bold and the cases.  Example ____ v. _____.  You'll get an A.","I loved his class even if it was in the evening.

He gives what you need to memorize before midterm and final. Those are exactly the exam questions--15 definitions and 1 case.  Take him if you just want an A.","I agree that he is so funny in the class. Everything was from his notes, you don't need to buy the textbook.

He can be a little tough when grading exams and papers, but if you take good notes and memorize the material thoroughly you shouldn't have a problem.

His tacky jokes are comic relief for his long but clear and concise lectures.  He is a lenient and generous grader.

Don't go to his lectures because you're better off teaching yourself.  The labs and lectures he gives will not prepare you for a quiz/test.

Your grade is based off of 3 test and the final. He drops the lowest test if your final is higher. GO TO OFFICE HOURS. He goes off on a tangent a lot which makes class enjoyable. Take him if you can!","Your whole grade is based off of 4 tests and nothing else. He tends to go off on tangents a lot but is overall an incredible teacher who is so obviously passionate about what he teaches. Going to his office hours is SOOO helpful I can't stress that enough. He's always wiling to answer the same question 6 times until you understand the material.","Fields is the man! Show up to class and take notes and you will do great on the tests! I bought the textbook and never opened it once because his tests come straight from lecture. Overall my favorite professor at JMU. I got a B doing very minimal work.","Fields is the best econ teacher JMU has to offer! Like any other econ class, you do have to work for it. Textbook is not needed and you shouldn't but it. Attendance isn't mandatory but I advice you to show up because lectures are important and if you pay attention, almost everything he says will show up on the test! His study guides were helpful!","Fields is great! He drops the lowest of your three tests and double weights your final if it's higher. Also, non mandatory attendance but gives you a boost in grade if you have less than 6 absences. He goes off on a lot of tangents but honestly, he's the best ECON prof at this institution. HANDS DOWN.","worst professor ive ever taken.  he goes off on tantrums and stories about his life that has nothing to do with macro.  doesnt explain the material well at all, and im a fairly good student and had no hope.  i had to withdrawl form the class, along with multiple others people.  do not take him, especially if ur going in the business college.","This man is a GOD SEND. This is the first time I have ever used this site - but he deserves to be known as one of the greatest professors on the JMU campus. Econ is rough - but he is fair, helpful, and SO SO patient. He does not make you feel dumb in office hours and he will explain things in so many different ways. TAKE HIM.","Econ is a hard class no matter what but Professor Fields make it interesting to learn about. He has stories to go with a bunch of the topics learned, he also has a witty side to him. I would definitely recommend doing the review questions and going to the PASS Sessions","It's true that you either get econ or you don't, but if not you can still get a good grade. His lectures are informative, but not too dense as he cuts it up with funny, relevant tangents. He explains everything well, is very knowledgeable & welcomes questions, esp at office hours. DO THE REVIEW QUESTIONS. Don't need the textbook.","Your grade is 3 tests and a final. Attendance is not mandatory but the tests are based completely on the lecture and if you do not go you will fail. Overall a knowledgeable guy and is available during office hours. Go to class, do the example problems, and go to office hours and ask questions and you will be fine.","Professor Fields is one of the greatest teachers I've ever had. Macro is a very hard class just because it is a lot of information in a short amount of time, but Fields made this class enjoyable to go to and it was by far my favorite class this semester. 4 Tests, and he does drop the lowest grade and makes your final double if it helps your grade","Professor Fields is by far the best macro teacher you can take.  He explains everything clearly and he is always willing to help.  Macro is hard, but the way he teaches it, I found that I actually loved the subject.  Take him if you can, he is awesome!","Dr. Fields was my favorite professor first semester of freshman year. If you go to class, office hours, pass sessions, and do his review guides, you will be set for the class. He knows what he is talking about and will give you the grade you deserve. Drops one test at the end of the year if it helps you and gives EC if you miss fewer than 6 classes","He is a great professor. He loves what he does and gives out study guides that is basically the test. Also allows a note card on every test which I didn't even need because he taught the material well. TAKE HIM.","One of the best professors I have had at JMU. I actually enjoyed going to his class even though I'm not a big fan of Economics. He keeps the class interesting so take him if you can.","He is the MAN. Is definitely at the end of his teaching career so goes of on life tangents that are just fantastic. Extremely knowledgeable, but is completely honest when he doesn't know the answer to your question - will do some research and get back to you.","Dr. Fields is a great guy. Didn't use the textbook. Take him for the life advice. However, I strongly recommend going to his office hours for clarification on all the review questions. He is really laid back and rants about random topics. His class isn't easy and tests were weirdly worded and multiple choices could seem right, choose the best one.","I'm not very interested in economics, and Fields tends to ramble on about nothing, but I'd take him again. His tests are all based entirely on what he talks about in class, and the review questions are extremely helpful.","He's alright.  Mostly he teaches in ways that are a little difficult to translate into the real world.  And he teaches macro mostly from the standpoint of monetary theory.  Picky grader.  Sometimes won't even explain why he took off your grade.","This guy knows his stuff.  Definitely wise in the ways of econ.  Explains everything well, and there is no HW.  4 tests is the entire class.  He gives you the test (8 questions) a week before and randomly selects 3 the day of the test.

There are only 3 tests and 5 pop quizzes so you have to do good on everything.","4 exams, 3 midterms and a cumulative final thats worth 2 tests. Read his powerpoints and follow up by reading textbook. a few pop quizzes. He gets off topic a lot and takes 3 classes to go over 25 slides.. Will call you out for being on your phone/leaving early. tests are conceptual, he wants you to understand. Overall BORING class but nice guy.","He knows the material but he hates teaching this course, so it gets super boring. He posts all the powerpoint material on canvas, although he gives pop quizzes that DO effect your grade. He usually does one the class before break too. He is an awesome person, this class just sucks. Exams are hard, take notes and read the textbook.","He knows the material is boring so he tries to make it as interesting as possible. If you can manage to get test banks from someone you'll be able to make an A or B in the class easily. The final was extremely hard. He'll do like 2-3 pop quizzes randomly that count for extra credit and will boost your grade like 4 points so go to cass","The subject matter is very straightforward. Go to class, don't go to class, it doesn't matter much - you can study the powerpoint presentations (which he posts online) and still finish with an A.","Professor Jernigan is very nice, but lectures can be very dry.  Bring your laptop to class so you can work on the homework to save yourself time.  Tests are a lot tougher than they need to be, struggled to make C's on most of my tests.  Learnsmarts take forever, so start them early.","Hilarious guy. Class can get boring sometimes but he'll throw in a funny story here and there. I feel like he thinks things shouldn't be harder than they actually are, and this is reflected in his tests. Pretty easy, just show up 7 times out of 10 for attendance grade.","He will get off topic with things not on the exam, but the exam is pretty straight forward if you study the book and his power points BOTH. Attendance is not required, but when 30/250 show up, he'll give a pop quiz about what our shoe size is or the game scores from the weekend before (He'll let you look it up/ask around.)","Nice teacher but his lecture is boring. Study hard, he test EVERYWHERE!!!","Never went to class because the lectures are so boring. Tests are straight out of the book and mostly definition. Learnsmart and connect teach you everything you will need to know for the class.","Nice person, but can get very boring sometimes. Tests are not hard. I'd recommend reading the textbook (besides the PPTs) when preparing for the tests.","Easy, just read the slides, attendance not req. (only 2 in class assign at random)if it were not for Connect HW, book not needed, plenty of extra pts on test. He makes it very easy to get a B.","WoW! Jernigan is a fairly nice guy, but has no idea how to teach. Be careful, tests are extremely tricky. You may think you know the definition of charisma or motivation, but think again. Reads straight from slides..so boring. Test material could come from powerpoints, textbook, or perhaps some book he is reading in his spare time. Avoid!!!","I am in this course right now and have really enjoyed it so far.  The tests are pretty easy as long as you study the slides.  I made an A on the last test and did not even read the book.  He gives extra credit points when a lot of people skip class.","Dr. Jernigan is a Great Professor.  Go to class and take notes on Powerpoints that he has posted on Blackboard.

No reason to buy the book.  3 Tests 1 Cumulative Final.","Prof makes exams tougher than they need to be, but I made a B without reading the chapters.  Final is much easier than exams.  Try to attend every class, quizzes are random but very easy.  Try to talk to him so he knows you and you will be fine.  Good guy.","Class gets a bit boring but just take notes and bring a coffee and it's fine.  Participation grades seemed very random, make sure you let Mr. J know who you are so you actually get the grade you deserve.  Don't let the first test trick you, the second two get more difficult.  Study the slides, but takes notes from text when given the study guide.","This class was hard because he makes it hard. He is unorganized and doesn't know where to test from. His slides come from not just the book required but other books he uses personally. He loves his job though and will answer your questions.","I took Mr. Jernigan for MGMT 3140 & made a C in that class due to his insipid lectures and not very enlightening textbook.

Avoid at all costs. ","Dr. Farthing is the quintessential college professor. He does not spoon-feed his students. If you want to do well in his classes you actually have to study and show up. Yes, he's old school. Which means he has seen every kind of lazy student there is, so don't try that here. If you don't do the work, don't trash the prof here.

He says 1 thing is OK on an upcoming exam and then after the exam changes his mind and hacks away at your grade.

Tests are easy if you actually take notes, go to class, read the book, and study. His outlines basically give away everything you could need to know for the exams.","He is condescending, rude and intimidating towards his students. He does not sufficiently answer student's questions and is not very concerned or willing to help his students. His exams are difficult, but he is very intelligent and knows what he is talking about. The study guides are extremely long and end up being overwhelming and not helpful.","Has little interest in Gen Psych, shows it. Only professor to make it a difficult class. Most PSY 100 students claim class is easy A, most of his students struggle to maintain B's. Tests have little to do with material in either book or lectures. Heard his upper-level psych classes are ok, personally had such an awful experience not willing to try.","This class was rather dull. Professor Farthing is the epitome of the \"sage on the stage\" manner of teaching. Participation is 5 hours of research is a required component of the course. Extra credit is offered, and study guides are posted for all tests. Not a terrible class, but the professor was not very helpful.","Professor Farthing is a very intelligent man and I love that he doesn't teach from the book all the time.  He incorporates his own research, his own experiences and interesting videos in his lectures.  This course is easy, but you do have to attend class.  His test questions are taken directly, word for word off the handouts he gives in class.","Farthing's class is hard, his tests are hard, he speaks in monitone and his study guides are almost 10 pages long. He's the proessor we were all scared to have entering college. To me, however, if you do the work, you'll do fine- as with anything. The only real preblem I have with Farthing is how unapproachable he is.","Get ready to teach yourself. Terrible class and even worse so called Professor.

Very lengthy study guides that, if you have time to study them, are probably useful...","Would have dropped sooner if I had realized how much I cannot stand his class. I also take PSY 251 (Motivational psych) and they're HORRIBLE. Exams often have confusing questions (misleading) and his 8pg study guide is over the top.

Tests are AWFUL, and you basically have to teach yourself to pass. He's very abrupt and rude when students have questions, and even brushes people off, saying \"Well shouldn't you know that by the reading?\" Even after he asks if we need clarification.

HOW DO YOU EXPECT US TO LEARN MATERIAL THAT WAS CONFUSING ON THE MIDTERM AGAIN. This guys needs to have open book test because honestly there is too much info to learn in such a short time.","Professor is nice and respected in the accounting industry. THATS IT. He does not know how to teach. Tests are extremely difficult and are nothing like the HW & lectures. \"Learned\" 4 chapters in 2 weeks. This guy gave us 2 group projects and still had the nerve to go to Taiwan for three weeks.  Class is unbelievably boring.  READ THE BOOK.","The professor is good, but the grading standard is confused, the syllabus said that there are several parts consist of the grade, but actually, the final exam take much more consideration than what he said on the syllabus in grading. It seems that the grading standard on syllabus is a joke.","Expected a lot out of this professor because he hypes up how distinguished he is. However, he left a lot to be desired. His homework is very easy but does absolutely nothing to help prepare you for his brutal tests. Final was 75 MC questions and 7 simulations.

Always connected via mails in case of any queries.","He knows his stuff, but is not great at teaching it to the class.  Exams are difficult, but you do get a chance to earn some extra credit.  I had to teach myself throughout the course and ask other students for help.  Also the HPC report was very vague and he did not answer any questions on how to do it.  ","Professor Needles is very passionate about accounting.  However, he does not do the best job of explaining problems to the class.  My biggest complaint is that most of the class is filled with full time students who are majoring in accounting.  Those of us in the part-time evening program have a tough time getting to the extra credit events.  ","I really didn't find Needles to be as tough as everyone makes him seem. It's audit... of course the material will be difficult. However, I didn't find his tests any more difficult than other 300 level honors accounting classes.

Fourier series, PDEs, and contour integrals are a few examples. Sad to hear he left because he was the best at explaining complex concepts and I almost changed my major to math.","The best math professor ever!","I also took him without trigonometry and passed the class with an A! Anybody who thinks he's hard is wrong. If you ask questions, he will explain. It's college math, of course it's going to be a little challenging. I also agree that your grade reflects upon your quizzes/tests. But he is the best teacher ever. Take him!","Yes. This class is pretty hard. His tests are okay. However, I got a B in this class without taking Trigonometry. I was barely entering college and had not taken Pre-Calculus for a while. Dr. Gervasi is very enthusiastic about his teaching. He is very helpful after class. Your grade is either your quizzes or your tests. He's a great teacher though.","He's a great guy but not a great teacher... Says he gives partial credit but he dosn't.. His final was very unfair and was more clac 2 based instead of calc 1...

Stern, but very easy going. Homework isn't turned in, but you better complete it. quizzes are hw problems.  Great teacher, which is good because advc math txtbooks tend to be utterly confusing.

Expect homework assingments every class, and to meet once a week on the weekends for a group discussion of the films you watched throughout the week. Classes are long but go by fast. Clips he shows are great, and he has a big sense of humor. You'll enjoy the discussions and learn alot.","JW is brilliant  it's as simple as that. He knows what he's talking about and will ensure that by the end of the semester, you will too. I've never felt so engaged in a class and that my ideas were being thoroughly examined, digested and respected. He genuinely cares about his students and the material he is presenting. A must-take!","I wish he were more aware of modern diversity and the issues at hand. His sources are outdated and reflect a world view he has set in his mind. Needs to be more open to progressive thinking.","Read everything you are assigned to and write your quotes. write a couple of papers and a group project and a group project is all that you have to do.It might sound easy but it is very time consuming.

By far one of the best teachers on campus TAKE HIS CLASSES","It's funny reading people's (whiners)comments about J.W. Wiley.  He is one of the most accessible profs you will ever meet, but he expects you to work. If you don't, then you will probably get graded for what you didn't do.

A LOT of reading & papers, don't take the class unless REALLY interested! Great material, enlightening!!","AMAZING PROFESSOR! I think everyone who doubts his abilities are closed minded. He is willing to listen to ANYTHING you have to say regardless of your race religion or sex. He opens your mind and makes you challenge your beliefs and if you can't do that then yes I can understand you misinterpreting him, but you've got it all wrong.

I've learned soo much, I am forever changed bc of this course & plan to take another w/ him.","Hes funny, smart, and will go to the limit for his students. I was a bit intimidated by him in class at times but at the end of the semester he took me aside and thanked me for one of the best papers he has ever read in that class. Coming from him that was an honor and I was grateful to him and the class. I just wish there are more like him at PSU!","Definately not worth the hype. This class is interesting I guess if you have never thought about diversity before...ever. It was nothing I haven't realized or heard before. It's nearly impossible to go against his opinion in class without him making you seem like a bigot. Just tell him what he wants to hear and don't think into it too much.","You will learn a lot about yourself.  You will learn a lot about your classmates.  READ.  Let me say it again, READ.  If you don't read you will loose everything this class tries to instill in people.","Awful teacher mean, pig-headed,belittling,close-minded!","I have taken 3 classes with him and I wish that more would fit in my schedule.

His lectures consist of him working out problems and he made the class really understandable. If you attend class, there is no reason why you shouldn't get an A because his tests are parallel. He grades based on 4 tests and a final but if you attend he drops the lowest test.","Professor Lintner is outstanding he teaches more in an old-school fashion by working out problems as a class then giving you problems to try on your own, which I came to love.

Just do HW andhe will help you during tests if you ask.","Lintner was a great guy, but this was supposed to be an intro to Calculus if you had never had it before, but instead he jumped right into the Calculus material and I was completely lost the whole semester. He only has 4 tests so you better do good on them. He also has another job so it is hard to get his personal help.","TAKE HIS CLASS!!! He is amazing! He really explains the concepts well. He has a part-time job, so he can only teach at night. So if you need help you can either meet with him before or after class, or go to the tutoring center.","I loved my calculus class with him.

However, if you have never taken it before I would not recommend Lintner. He is a great guy, but he does not teach the material very well and he is never available outside of class. The good thing is all of the homework is optional and he drops your lowest test grade.","Really great guy but when he teaches he already expects you to know the basic material so it's hard to comprehend.  I went to the SSC for tutoring every day before class to do the homework because I couldn't do it with just the notes in class.","4 Test's, drops lowest score, no homework, and a final.

There is little to no structure to how the class is organized. Many spelling errors in the exams and even the textbook. It is never clear what will be on exams.

Also does not use blackboard/is completely unreachable outside of class.","This teacher is a fool, DO NOT TAKE AT ALL COST. Do not let your friend talk you into taking this class, it is a setup. She is unprofessional and needs to get her teaching license taken away.","She told the class to buy textbooks towards the end of the semester, this woman is old and needs to retire. She doesn't have the compacity to teach a college anymore.","Do. not. take.","Do not waste your time with this teacher, If someone says it's an easy A it is, but it is not a guaranteed A in her class. Do yourself a favor and look for another teacher. She grades off what she thinks, not facts. The class is based on a midterm that she doesn't give much information on, and a final. Class isn't mandatory.","Her class was super disorganized. Do not do it to yourself. Attendance is required but it was never taken. Our grade was based on a midterm, final and attendance only. So if you fail one it basically determines your grade. A nice person but not a good professor!","It is time for her to retire. She has had to cancel class 5 times already and when she is there she doesnt teach and is all over the place and super unorganized. The final is tomorrow and I have no idea when or where its going to be and I cant email her because she never activated blackboard and she doesnt tell us our grades. Awful.","She doesn't have a blackboard or an email. The lectures don't follow the syllabus, if they cover material listed at all. There are two required readings, one of which is a book that she wrote herself. The questions that she asks sometimes in lectures are unclear and she fails to elaborate when asked to do so. She doesn't understand accommodations","Professor Wangari is very understanding however, she didn't follow the syllabus AT ALL. The class was all over the place, we barely stayed on topic and when it was time to take the exam, questions we never even addressed in class came up. It was a very chill class.","I would not recommend this course with this professor because instruction was absolutely terrible. I was very interested in the course topic, unfortunately very few of our discussions really addressed the issues women face on the global stage. Any questions from students were met with nonchalance, and sometimes even anger.","I think Professor Wangari is a very nice person, but as a teacher she is very hard to learn from. She isn't organized and there is no structure to her class. The class is easy to pass but if you really are interested in the class and want to learn I would recommend not taking her.","It's not a class worth taking, you don't know how your grade is calculated so your final grade will most likely not reflect the work you put in","Show up to most classes because she cares about your participation and learning your name. Just buy the books she asks you to buy BC it'll help a little. We had one little paper to write on a book and one midterm that she technically gave us the answers to the class before and then the final. Very unclear on directions all year but Easy A or B","First and foremost do not take this class, she is a sweet lady but the absolute worst at teaching! The class itself is not bad at all, its just the way that she teaches. She does not update on Blackboard, does not give any work back, and her grading is not clear what-so-ever. The midterms and final are NOT take home!","Get a classmate and share the book. You can finesse your way out of using the book because we discuss the same topics every class. Don't skip class. She's a very sweet woman but isn't the most organized professor. She doesn't use Blackboard so it's almost impossible to know your exact grade. You should get an A at the end of it.","Be ready for a lot of heated arguments and discussions in class. Although many of the arguments were controversial, Professor Wangari stayed more unbiased then I would assume most women studies teachers would. A major downfall of the class was how disorganized the curriculum and grading was but as long as you show up and participate its an easy A.","Almost every class is a discussion, some of them get very heated. Wangari has strong opinions and is not afraid to voice them. May not always be supportive of your opinions if they do not match hers. She will stress how important attendance is, but I still got a decent grade without attending much. Do not buy her book, split the price between group","TAKE THIS CLASS! Yes, she has an accent. It's really not bad. She is so sweet and we didn't do anything the last few weeks. No tests, two papers, everything she gives is take home including the mid term and final. Easy A if you participate and and read a little bit.  ","Show up and talk. 1st Day of class will be setting everyone into groups that focus on a different social factor throughout the year. She'll stress that everyone needs to buy the book. DON'T! Literally 1 person in the group have it and split up the cost among your group members. Scan the book ch's for everyone to read. No tests. 2 papers.","A very interesting professor to say the least, has years under her belt and knows her stuff.

The tests were easy, but she sometimes put things on the tests that she said we didn't have to know. It was a horrible mistake to take her class.","She is a knowledgeable professor and you could leanr from her, but her lack of ability to communicate with students, her tendency to mumble, trail off, and not finish thoughts and sentences leads to unbearably boring discussions and a tedius learning environment. Also, needs to study less Didion.","awful teacher! She was awful at explaining what she was teaching. Her classes are hard, borring and lectures are painfully borring.","Alot of reading, course could be improved by more writing assignments.","Possibly the lease helpful teacher.  She tries, but just fails to get any useful information out of her mouth.  The textbook she chose was poorly edited, worthlessly organized, and just useless.

No one could seem to get an A on their writing assignments but I did, and I don't know why everyone thinks she's so hard. Just think deeply about the films and don't get on her bad side.","I learned next to nothing in this class. Rapf was VERY opinionated and cared only about her own opinions. She was too harsh of a grader and assumes we all think the way she does. Literature should be about your own personal interpretation not just a set standard as she believes. I would never take her again.","Loved professor Rapf! She definitely wasn't easy, but if you keep up with the readings and really give your best effort, you can definitely make an A. She's also really helpful if you ever have questions and she curved all of my classes grades at the end! I made a 70 on her final and still got an A! Professor Rapf Rocks! I learned so much from her!","I took Film Narrative. She is extremely passionate about the films, but she expects the class to know more about film making than they actually do. You write a lot of papers but as long as they improve each time you will get an A. Improvement is all she cares about which was really nice!","LOTS of writing. but the films are great and she has a great enthusiasm for them.

I always got the grade I deserved.","Taking her class was truly a pleasure.  She was very kind professor and very enthusiastic.  It is a quest or a journey, so to speak, and that was what made the class worthwhile.  Meanwhile, learning is happening, even if you don't realize it.  She really opened up the works we studied to me in a whole new way.  She is an asset.","This **** assisted the chairman in ruining my graduate career at OU.  Make no mistake--she will stab you in the back even if you make an A in her class--which I did.  As a teacher, she is mediocre at best.  She roots AGAINST our athletes, esp. the football team.

Assumes a lot about students backgrounds. Doesn't want students opinions, but reguritated references to the reading over all.","My experience in Dr. Rapf's class was less one of learning and more one of sharing a journey or quest, if you will.  I found it both noble and inspirational to aid her on her struggle toward understanding the English language so painfully late in life.","She is so knowledgeable and excited about this topic.

Difficult readings, but incomparably rewarding in terms of the trajectory of 20th century thought. The pace of the course adjusts to the needs of the students.","He genuinely cares about his students. Although his lectures are boring, he really likes when students participate and will give brownie points. He gives good comments on papers. He gives review questions for exams and picks from the list. If you are not truly interested in philosophy, don't take this class.","I took his Heidegger class, which was the first time I ever read Heidegger. I had taken existentialism and phenomenology and heard his name, which is why I took it. I seriously enjoyed reading Heidegger and want to read more of what he wrote. The class was mostly lecture and little discussion, but he's a great lecturer and interesting to listen to.","Tests are tough, a B is good. Pay attention in lectures and you'll do well. Reading helps too. I fell asleep but that's only because I had it at 9:30.","Lecture is very painful.  No powerpoint, no website, just chalk and a chalkboard and his boring voice.  Lectures are unclear and unorganized.  Extremely difficult to study for exam questions. TA's grade your work but they grade very harshly.  Avoid this class if you can.","section was extremely painful, the TA couldn't facilitate discussion at all--they are mandatory. the reading was really boring. dahlstrom was a nice guy and good at explaining the reading, but grading was def. arbitrary. not enough time to finish tests.

Class was very patient and even relaxing at times. Never got to the third book, so you might not want to buy all the books at once. Little reading, all exams are take-home, a bit time-consuming but its not too bad.","He was boring.  The texts were horrible.  I didn't learn anything.  Class was too big.  NO discussion whatsoever, except for the 3 people in the class that ever talked.  I wanted to drop my philosophy concentration after this class.","I had not taken a philosophy class before and I found this enjoyable, but tough. The lectures were great and the Sartre and Nietzsche readings were excellent also. I didn't do well on the papers, but everything else about the class made it great.","Professor Dahlstom is very engaged and knows how to relate to a college audience.  I would highly recommend taking this class to fulfill a requirement--it was at 930 am and i never fell asleep.  He enjoys the subject matter and can relate it to college students.","Dahlstrom is a really nice guy and enthusiastic but sometimes I think he can be unclear.

His understanding of content is dated, his tests are irrelevant and ill conceived, and his lectures are nothing, but directionless stumblings through equally ludicrous hand outs. I've learned nothing and gained nothing, but a fine arts credit. avoid.","Shannon desperately searches for meaning in far-fetched and often irrelevant text book content rather than the historic or artistic aspects of the discipline. Additionally, he wastes class time with terribly unstructured, blunder filled excuses for lectures. If you value your GPA you ought find another fine arts credit.","He spends his class time \"broadly interrelating\" everything under the sun and ad-libbing his entire lecture. He tests based on vague, misconceived, and convoluted learning goals which really just boil down to a random combination of quotations and opinions.

Won't take again, just not for me.","He's a good guy, very funny. I guess you have to be when you teach about literature everyone's already seen before. Assignments are easy, just forum posts once a month-ish and a couple of short papers. Textbook is recommended but not necessary because its classic literature, the stories can be found everywhere. Tests are multiple choice.","He is a very genuine person, often funny, and overall great instructor. His class was a great way to start the day.

Him teaching online got so bad that a different teacher had to replace him. He'd go on random history rants that somewhat related to the class.

Online, he would not use Canvas and I wouldn't be able to contact him through his email.","I usually take RMP with a grain of salt but please, I mean this in the most genuine, unbiased manner possible... DO NOT TAKE. Unclear grading, does not know how to use canvas, and most importantly, you wont learn. Youll be that much more behind when you eventually transfer and youll wish you had a competent instructor. Nice guy Im sure, but no.","Doesn't use canvas. Rambles off topic and incoherently. Very few assignments.. sounds great? Not if you see his wacky midterm and final. He provides a \"study guide\" for both that is not very helpful for either. His handwriting is almost as bad as his accent. Syllabus is a joke, unclear grading criteria, won't find out grade until class is over","To be clear, this professor sucks and you do nothing the whole class. However, this is great if you want to add some extra units and get homework done for other classes. As stated by others, no assignments are do and he rambles about stuff you can't understand because of his low voice and accent. One more time, this class sucks lol","Professor Nyong is a cool person, however he gets off topic a lot or rambles on too long about a topic. Does not use canvas at all, also you won't know your grade until the end of the semester when it is posted on your transcript. Class is really boring, and you won't learn anything but it is easy and you have flexibility on turning in assignments","On a grading standpoint the course is easy, yes, but if you leave the class not having learned anything, it says more about you than anything else. He's of great help while in his class and will even go out of his way to help you on coursework from other professors. Very knowledgeable in US history, foreign policy and government.","He mumbles between his teeth. Cant make sense of a single word PLUS he has no canvas or online notes for me to go off of and his syllabus is 1 page with no details. I couldn't even understand the gibberish he wrote on the bored, Its horrible. Please guys save yourselves.","He is extremely knowledgeable of U.S. and International Laws. He is not a tough grader and will work with you if you do the work. Use the book to follow the lecture because it helps a lot. He is hard to understand over the a/c so sit in the front if you want to hear him and participate.","This class was a boring nightmare. He is biased. Always talks bad about Trump and Trump supporters. Has a low voice. But if you're taking a heavy course load and want one less class to worry about I suggest taking him. Just show up to class and take notes and you'll be fine. Also, use his study guides for his test. I honestly hated his class though","He basically just talks for an hour and a half. No one can understand what hes saying. There are literally like 2 assignments (about 2 pages long). It is like watching paint dry. Easy credits, No doubt. But you will learn nothing and be bored. DONT BUY THE BOOK! you will not have to use it.","Don't take his class. He was so tough. Test was exceed and he didn't give specific study guide. Only one extra credit work. Don't take his class.","Very kind and knowledgable professor, but his class is a little different to say the least. You are graded on very few assignments, didn't use a book, and was basically only lectures. He tends to get off topic very easily, and the material should be studied because his lectures aren't clear or on topic.","The class is extremely boring. Dont expect to learn anything in his class. It is hard to understand what he is saying since his voice is not loud and clear. He tends to talk on and on in a very low voice to himself. If you can take another professor then do it.","Doesn't talk loud enough","I would not recommend you to take this class for anyone because it is the most boring class ever.

One group paper, no prompt, one extra credit opportunity. You need to put in so much work to do well. No office hours, no canvas page, you have no idea what your grade is.

Be prepared if you get stuck with people who don't contribute. Avoid if you can.","Trust these reviews - spare yourself. Nice person but he is very biased and his lectures are messy. He only lectures about anti-Trump, I think students deserve an objective professor. You are graded on 3 things and his notes/lectures dont match up and are not like the test.","Dr. Nyong is a professor who is very knowledgeable about subject matter. However, we never used the books.

He is not helpful at all when you go to his office, on the contrary, he yells at you and says he doesn't have time to talk to you. He is horrid. I would have given 0s, but 1s are the lowest","Does not take the time to listen to your questions before trying to answer them. Rambles a lot about irrelevant topics and gives tests that are unfair from the standpoint of how much time you've been given to learn the material. He is very smart, but just doesn't connect well with people, thus doesn't know how reasonable his expectations  are.","Dr. Heath sucks. Period. He goes over the simplest material in class, then tests over the hardest stuff that you've never seen. He went over the worst material the day before the final, and 20% of the final was the new (extremely hard) material. Prepare to devote your life to this class if you want a good grade.","By far, this class has been the most difficult class I have ever taken.  The professor did not offer much help, lectured about things that we didn't use much, then made half of a test on material he covered once.  He graded very harshly, and set unrealistic expectations given an average course load. Overall, the class was horrid","Had him in 1992 for EE280.  Heath spent endless time on easy stuff. Tested on material not covered.  I am now a senior engineer, I would not hire anyone who said anything good about heath.  The man should be fired!  He failed almost the entire class.  He is completely worthless!","Horrible teacher, if possible wait a semester and take someone else.","Grades extremely harshly (-25 pts from 30pt problem for leaving out one semi-colon from 30+ lines of code).  Class average for his test was a 66. I had a 4.0 before, now I am about to get a D from this guy.  I study the material 4+ hours a night.","This is the worst professor I have ever had. All of my friends were extremely fed up by the end of the semester, and I just stopped going after the second test. This guy is ridiculous, and don't count on any fairness or curving. Terribly unclear on assignments, and new material was taught in the class right before the final.

At the end of the semester expect to be bent over by this ****...","Heath is a terrible teacher. In class he spends 45 minutes going over useless information, and only gets to the things that are actually on the homework at the very end of class because he rambled so long. He grades very harshly and does not adequately explain the material.","Heath has very high expectations from his students.

Goes on many tangents, but I personally found them to be really entertaining (and they often end up as quiz questions!). Exam was switched from a take-home to an in-person at the last minute which was SUPER inconvenient. That being said, it was a great course and D'Elia is a really fun lecturer.  ","Lectures are extremely dry, and rather than presenting ideas he reads straight from his notes as if he was narrating an audiobook. Zero guidance given for the papers, and says to look at the study questions for each week to draw inspiration, but then only provides study questions for 2 out of 12 weeks. Sucks because it could've been a fun course.","Makes things due at 5pm. If you have classes throughout the day you will have to complete everything beforehand. Doesn't care about what you have going on in your life.","Cannot keep focused; unprofessional.","Great prof, his lectures are interesting, he is funny, and he cares about his students.","Overall, not great. He was rude to me upon asking about a source for an essay over email, simply because he never clarified this source was uploaded online as part of a different one, but somehow that was my fault. Lectures are pointless, he reads directly off of a paper, and never expands as to why what he is talking about is important.","Great professor for Latin, very different from the typical, rigid-structure sorts that you usually get. Enthusiastic, and does like to ramble and digress into various subjects (so avoid his classes if you hate it when professors do that - personally I like variation). Always gives positive feedback, and tries to be as supportive as possible!","Simple class. 2 short essays, a midterm, and a final. HOWEVER, the midterm is based on 25 readings and the final on 50, so if you can't commit to this then don't bother taking it. The papers are easy A's. Lecture is extremely boring, he reads directly from his own book (I looked it up, it's word for word), so everything you need to know is online.","I really liked having Prof. D'Elia. He was very entertaining, and he definitely knew exactly what he was talking about. He was very approachable and open to talking about any walk of history, and was vastly knowledgeable on many topics. His lectures were never boring, and the subject matter  he covered made me more interested as lectures went on.","Goes through his lectures way too quickly, simply reading off of a piece of paper. He is very strange, not an awful prof but he is a terrible Undergraduate Chair of History; totally unfriendly and totally unhelpful. He does not seem to care in the least about the undergraduate history students that he represents","D'elia is very strange with an odd sense of humour.  That said, he's a great prof with well written lecture notes and I wouldn't hesitate to take another course of his.","Prof was really good, very interesting. Had lecture outlines which made it easy to follow along. Overall a good prof, clearly passionate for teaching and the subject. Would recommend his class for sure.","Kept lectures interesting and was quite a character!","He assigns far too much reading, since only a portion of it is eventually tested. The lectures themselves he reads word for word from a script. This doesn't make them necessarily boring, but they are hard to follow, as they are very dense. He is not terribly entertaining, but did a good job considering the amount of information he had to cover.","the lectures are really interesting.  he is an entertaining guy and definitely knows his stuff.  if ur taking history 121, take his class!","He is a great chap.  Like much of his humour.  His lecture notes are that great and one would wish he would have them in a downloadable word format.  he jumps from one century to the next but does it with some style and great intelligence.","Can be very unclear because he jumps between topics. His notes aren't very good, and he talks very fast so it is hard to keep up to when writing notes.","Reads his lectures and jumps from topic to topic. Very difficult to follow. The material itself is frivolous and uninteresting. Overall rating of the course: sticking a pointed, rusty object in my eye would have been less painful.

Grades consist of four tests which are not too hard to study for since they're more based around his lectures than the text book and he usually gives away a few answers in his review days. There are also two essays which are fairly easy to do well on. An enjoyable class for those interested in history.","Be ready on reading alot of chapters and write everything that he says in lecture. His tests are not easy and will make you think critically and they are  based on the combination of reading the  book and lectures. Good note-taking is a must! And also there's  2 papers you need to write for this class. Do all these things and you should get an A.","I enjoyed his class.  But I must agree with many others, his tests are based on his understanding of his lectures and they do tend to go off course.  All in All he is a good professor, just pay attention and think outside of the box.","A funny guy who's lectures are interesting and informative, but sometimes he'll go off topic for a while. Overall a good teacher, he's very clear about grading and you've got nothing to worry about if you keep up with the reading.","Professor OBrien is a great professor. He is very clear on what he expects. There are 2 Essays and 2 Exams. He does kind of go all over the place and gets off track, but hes very helpful. Hes been teaching for a very long time and knows a lot. The class can be very boring and long. He asks for a lot of feedback which is good. He is very quick to","Listen attentively in class, study your notes, & do the book review, there is no reason you can't pass this class w a B. I hated history in hs. I was not looking forward to having to take it in college. He obviously loves history and teaches it like a story without focusing on little details like dates; instead he wants you to get the big picture.","4 exams, multiple choice with written essay.  He provides essay question before exam. Tests off his lectures, but not everything from lecture is on exam. He is not structured and can get off topic easily. Does not teach from the book and I do not like that. However, everyone learns differently. Overall, a good professor.","Great professor. Get in, get the info you need, and get out. Very good at pointing out the info you will need on the test. Passed without buying the book, but I am a good note taker. Reasonable tests (4 I think), and no quizzes that I can remember. One essay if you want a grade above a 'C'","I had no desire, whatsoever, to take this class. Very fortunate, that I ended up taking him. In order to do well you must attend lecture, his tests are very easy if you go to class. He can sometimes get a little of subject but not a big deal considering he's normally telling a funny story.","He is a really nice man and enjoys his job. I found the material entertaining and interesting. He would tell you the stories with enthusiasm and if you have fun listening to the subject you'll enjoy it. I would definitely take him again","Horrible!! Disorganized and extremely inconsistent.  While the majority of his test material does come straight from his lectures, some of the material on the tests are never discussed in lectures.  An A in this class is next to impossible!!","Had a great time in this class. I took notes every class and recorded his lectures. I recommend doing this. He can get a little off topic from time to time but the lectures are interesting. He is a cool guy and makes the material not so dry. I work and go to school full time and didn't have any problems. I'm taking him again forthe next section","The class is simple and he makes his test soley on the information that he lectures about. However much of the information that he talks about is irrelevant, therefore you have to pick and choose the information that is useful. He is a really nice guy and a reasonable person. the test, curriculum and grading system is a little poorly put together.","Awesome class! Bought the book but hardly read...Taking notes and listening well in class was all it took for me to pull a solid B. He reviews for tests and pretty much lets you know what you need to know. He's pretty funny sometimes i suggest his class for History 1","Agreed with the comment below. Many of the questions on his tests are up to his interpretation. In other words, it doesn't really matter how much you study or take notes -- if you don't understand history as he does, it's much harder to get an A. Still, a B isn't that hard to get in his class.","dont take!!!!","honestly, i don't recommend this professor if you want an easy A or B. you have to read a LOT if you want to get a good grade. he's a nice guy though. i looked at the ratings on this site and registered, but i really regret it. i had to withdraw, and got a W on my transcript. after the first test he told us that most students either got an A or F:/","Good guy. Took for 5 week session during the summer. 3 tests and two had a little bit of writing on them. I didn't read the textbook at all after chapter 1 and still got an A. He's a good teacher and isn't out to trick you or prove his superiority in the subject. Sometimes he can get off subject.","His class is easy if you come to class and take notes or record what he says. Test are on what he lectures. I barely read the book and passed. He is very passionate about History and makes class interesting. I took him for both HIST 1301 & 1302.","Learn something new everyday! Attendance is a must! his tests are from his lectures.  Test are multiple choice n essay.  He gives u essay question day before so you can study.Recording lectures will help study for tests.  He is very passionate about history.

That project is basically my full-time job. Crazy workload. The worst part is, 90% of the project has nothing to do with software engineering, we just made algorithms to make a computer AI play a card game with you. I learned nothing. JP is just not good OK take it with someone else","JP is absolutely the worst prof in Carleton computer science, and I've had Mengchi Liu. If you value your sanity please take someone else for this course. He lies when he tells you what's on the final exam, half of what he says is on it isn't, and the other half is stuff that was barely covered.","The workload for the term-long group project is extremely intense. It had vague requirements that were updated every few days, and well over half the class dropped the course. The exam is open book (but not easy), and you are tested on a lot of specific wording. He bell curves based on the highest grade. (For us, a 72%.)","He is the best! He cares about his students. The course itself is not easy, project and final exam weren't easy at all! but he helps student to pass his course","Negligent, condescending professor. Assigns unrealistically large amounts of work, revises the term project specifications every two days, gives incomplete exam reviews, and then tests his classes on subject matter not taught in his lectures. More than 2/3 of our class dropped, and the remaining 1/3 have grouped up and reported him to the dean.","Jp is so bad, more than Half of the class dropped.","Half of the class drop.

Not only is he terrible at teaching his classes which don't add a lot of value (he just rants about Nortel and reads off slides) his requirements for the project (hardest project I have ever done and possibly for anyone not in 4th yr game dev) are horrendous.","Rants alot (very negative) about his days at Nortel and the software industry. He even ranted about a project manager that shafted him. The theory part of the course is really dated and from the 1990's.  Best advice Make sure you form a good team otherwise he will assign you with someone which doesn't always work out.","Sometimes going to his class feels like you time travelled back to his 1990s glory days of software dev. This is the second time I've had him and it was exactly the same. He's unorganized and a lot of the stuff isn't useful anymore. TDD, Selenium and Cucumber were fun but unfortunately that was a small part of the class.","Course felt like a game dev course for non-game-dev students. We spent the majority of the term deciphering an 80 pg rulebook for a game we needed to create. He did not give us a simple program to design so that we could focus on good design patterns and documentation. I highly recommend going to lectures to write notes to go with his for his exam","He is a very determined professor with a great attitude. Never hesitates to reply your questions to be of help as much as he can. He teaches a lot and gets you guys prepared for the real life, that's for sure. But get prepared for some tough assignments and stuff 'cuz he really expects you folks to learn. Overall, awesome professor!","Heavy load course with no exams (grad course). Heavy assignment and final project. but He does not give low grades.","Took this class with him last winter! I spent so much time in the lab .. There is a lot of group work, I mean alot of it make sure you get in a good group of people.. As for the final class avg was 42%, that says enough about what you guys are about to go through .. be prepared!","Good for talking a lot of real world experience that is hard to get in computer science.  If possible, take this course with a couple friends who you can work with, it's 100% group work and a lot of it.  Usually clear, but be careful of his marking scheme.  Takes off marks for wrong points instead of giving marks for correct points.","Doesn't really know how to write a test, but is EXTREMELY useful for real-world knowledge.

Had multiple classmates agree with this. His physical science class isn't so hard, but Astronomy is another story. I'm a straight A student, it was hard. Only assignments are exams.","In the process of dropping this class right now. I am a senior at UNCP and I have a 4.0. I am a finance major and I took this class for one of my science gen ed classes. It doesn't matter how hard you study and your book will not have your answers. I am struggling to get a C in this class.

You have to work hard","Fairly easy online class. You have to do the reading and go onto the websites she provides, but all the information is right there for you. No trick questions on tests. Each test has a one to two page essay associated with it. You get the question in advance and have four days to write it. Highly recommend.","Take it online! It's an easy class. There is a lot of reading, but you have three units, and they are about a month long each, so you just have to manage your time. 3 exams, 3- 4 small discussions for each unit, and a 1-2pg essay for the exams. Not very difficult if you do the readings. And you can always look online for answers.","Online class.  I really enjoyed this class.  The book is a boring read, but there is plenty of information linked to the online lectures.   Lectures are printed (no powerpoints).  Good feedback and quick grading.  Three exams with separate essays and unit discussion questions.  She gives you the essay topics in advance which is helpful!  Take her!","took Michigan history 313.

A bit arrogant and wants to make himself stand out. It's more likely you'll remember his endless jokes than the material after taking his class, but he keeps you awake in the morning.","Easy course!  Most people were done the final in about an hour.  I liked his lectures; he's so witty!","The material itself is pretty boring. So I have to give the prof some credit for making it a little more exciting. He tells too much unrelated stories however.

Learn how to do the practice exams he uploads from previous years and you should do fine on exams.","These ratings are from people who clearly skip class. He does example problems (great for visual learners) and explains concepts thoroughly. You literally just have to go to class and take good notes to do well in this class. Exams are based on theories - know them, he likes to put questions that'll trip you up if you don't. He is a wonderful man","Do not take him as a professor! He refused to lecture to our Calc 1 class after classes went online. He also wasted in-person lecture time when we had it. He uses half of the class talking about theory and proving a theory, only to show that the theory he just spent 30 minutes proving to be true is actually incorrect. I only learned from the TA.","Honestly, Prof. K seems like a really smart dude, but he's not really the best in teaching and communicating what he's trying to tell us. Like others said, a lot of proofs and theories, but not a lot of practicals. GO TO SI!! I feel like SI taught me more and Prof. K's lectures were supplemental to it. Please brush up on pre-calc if u can","not a good lecturer, hope u get a good TA. utilize practice tests online and study and you will be fine, everything, including final, is curved pretty heavily. i went into the end of the sem thinking i had a B- but then when grades were posted i ended up with an A.","Not as bad as people say he is. He does a lot of proofs you won't use, but when he does practical problems pay attention. Also, he posts practice tests with answers online which are invaluable study tools. Take notes, do practice tests and don't procrastinate on homework and you'll probably get an A cause he also curved the final.","I went into this thinking that \"oh this guy can't be that bad\" and now I wish I never ignored the ratings on this page. I shouldn't even be going to SDSU in my opinion. The school in general just sucks. But back to the topic, yeah this teacher sucks. He goes through problems and says \"You need this skill\" yet doesn't exactly explain how to get it.","THIS PROFESSOR DID SO MANY UNNECESSARY PROOFS BUT TAKE NOTES ON THE EXAMPLE PROBLEMS HE DID. HE IS THE BEST PROFESSOR AND HE CURVES THE CLASS SO THAT AN 80% IS AN A . HE IS VERY NICE!! ATTENDANCE MATTERS ON RANDOM \"CHECK\" DAYS.","BE CAREFUL! This class is designed for you to fail if you have never taken Calc. You will waste 3 hrs/week in lecture. I suggest using that time for HW or learning Calc online. Do the HW diligently, on pace. You will have to teach yourself all of Calc at a high level. This is a huge task to juggle, so be prepared. Kirsch makes SDSU look like a joke","I got an A solely because of my high school calc class/teacher. Kirschvink is not good at teaching this material, he knows calculus, but teaches all theory and not how to do the problems which isnt helpful. If you HAVE to take kirschvink, do the sample tests, learn from TA'S, and take notes on anything. If you arent good at math, you will struggle.","Not that bad; you're given many resources (SI, MLC, office hrs, etc.) to pass. Take the ALEKS module seriously if you want a firm grasp on pre-calc. I suggest taking notes of both the lecture AND the textbook. The homework is super useful so don't procrastinate! The practice exams are invaluable. Take time to study your resources & you'll be fine!","I do not think Kirshvink is as bad as others make him out to be. Is he really good? No, but there is really no reason that a person should fail this class. Kirshvink spends 75% of the lecture on the proof, and the other 25% doing a practical problem. The T.A.'s are there to help you, the MLC will help you, and SI sessions will teach you even more","Kirschvink is one of the worst professors at SDSU. He does not explain the material very well at all, so if you never took calculus in high school then you are pretty much screwed. I had already taken it before but I can tell that if I had not, I would have no clue what was going on. Very boring in lectures but necessary to come for clicker points!","If you took AP Calc AB in high school you should be fine. I'm a sophomore bio major and got a 90% and 87% on the first two midterms so far. His proofs and examples can be a bit arbitrary but honestly if you go to small section (many people skip) and go to the MLC to get help with the online homework this class is fine.

Failed most of my exams.","Kirschvink on a nutshell: \"arbitrarily\" \"infinitesimally\", theories, number lines, and \"number sense\". It was too much work to teach myself calculus while still attending all of his vague and unhelpful lectures for participation points.

I feel that for students who want to learn should NOT take this professor.","So sweet and caring! I learned a lot from her, although sometimes she did get very sidetracked which made a lot of work at home on my own, but she was always willing to help. Showing up and trying on the papers is all I had to do to pass with an A!","Wonderful and caring teacher, can be a little unorganized at times.

She will help anyone, all you have to do is ask. Pay attention to her lectures. She makes English easy!","i had a four hour class with her. it was bad i feel as if she could stop all the side talk and ranting off subject class would be more effective","Ellen is the sweetest lady. But she is so scatty that I had an incredibly hard time sitting through her class. She was always forgetting things and was very, very unorganized. She rambled on about things unrelated to the class. I would get agitated sitting in her classroom. Super nice and helpful, but I would never take a class with her again.","Oh, what to say about dear Ellen?? She is very swett and kind as a person, however as a teacher, I do think she should have retired a few years ago. She is very disorganized and rambles for hours, then at the last 10 minutes of class tries to quick tell us everything we need to know. This is not a hard class, but very hard to sit through two hours.","Very sweet.  Will help with anything you're working on.  Nice to everyone.  A bit forgetful at times but nothing to worry about. :3","This lady is sweet and hillarious. Shes old and very forgetfull. There is a lot of reading and papers but they're not too bad.

He curves at the end, so you don't really know where your grade stands.","This class was one of the harder ones I've taken, next to mis301. Tyagi does mandatory attendance based on a seating chart. His lectures are so boring... he talks at the speed of a snail and it puts you to sleep. The group project is a lot of work, but he spaces it out throughout the semester which makes it easier at the end. Tests were hard.","Class is difficult and his lectures are long. I had to read the book several times in order to understand the material.","Boring lectures. Went from 80% B- before curve and ex cr being applied and got a B+ as my final grade so can't complain.","Boring class. He reads off ppts the whole time as students write as quickly as they can. He will not post the ppts on blackboard. 25% of the grade hw/participation/attendance then 3 exams @25% each. The HW each week is 100 LS questions. He does not update attendance/participation/ex cr grades until final grade. Exams can be a bit tricky- 60 MC qs.","Don't sit in the back, I could barely hear him even when he adjusted the volume. Takes attendance, creates a seating chart for it. Lectures are same material as the book, the exams felt just like the LearnSmart homework for me. Lectures are long and boring. Average exam difficulty. ","grade is based on 3 exams and one major group project. make sure to get a good group and don't wait till last minute to start this project! exams are tough but doable. focus on taking good notes in class because thats what the exams are based on. do well early to give yourself a cushion for 3rd exam. otherwise pretty standard for upper division. ","Test were based off lectures so attendance is important. Tests were really tricky","He is really really boring to listen to, but pretty easy class. Just take notes in class when he writes on the board and study powerpoints and read pages he tells you. 4 test, ATTENDANCE IS MANDATORY, he has a seating chart and takes attendance by it everyday.","Absolute JOKE!  Avoid him if you can.  He represented everything that is wrong with the MBA: No industry experience, treats you like a child, and completely out of touch with current business.  How can you honestly run a marketing research class with no qualitative research work.  All that was bad but the lecture was the worst, dry and meaningless.","He was a great professor! His lectures were a little dull at times but he was very helpful and the tests were straight from the book and lecture. If you put the time in, you will do well in this class.","Prof. Tyagi is awesome! Probably my favorite prof. at State. Attend lectures and took good notes and you'll be fine. Never opened the textbook and got an A (he tests directly from his notes). The group project is long and tedious but if you get a good group then you should be fine. Take him if you want to learn something and want a helpful teacher","This class isn't that bad, just read the book thoroughly and take good lecture notes (most questions come from it). I took it in summer school so the project wasn't that bad, but make sure to pick a good group.","very nice teacher. test are all about the lectures so pay attention. I learned a lot and the tests are not very hard if you pay attention. I think he's the best teacher to take for marketing. Fair grader. Take in summer so you won't have to do project. just 3 tests.","Very understanding. He told our class we didn't have to do presentations for our projects since we fell behind. Pushed back tests when he felt we needed more time to study. No study guide but if you take good notes he covers everything that will be on the test in class. Text book is good for clarification. Not too bad of a class.","I thought he was great. He's a super nice guy and he's really funny. He definitely wants you to learn and is super helpful. Just write down what he writes on the board and you're good. 3 tests and a project. He's very reasonable too. Like if he thinks we need more time to study for a test, he'll push it back. Highly recommended.","He is a really  nice teacher.  All tests are based on lecture.  Pay attention in class bc you will need to focus on what he writes on the board.  I took this during summer and he gives you clear instruction on what you need to study.  Tests can be a little tricky, so pay attention to the small details.  Overall not bad class I got a B.","Textbook required for exams. Exams based largely on lectures, so you need to go to class. Project is difficult. Grades fairly. Not too hard, but it's not an easy A.

Attendence is not mandatory, however his tests cover his lectures. If you miss, read the book. Also, going to the SI helps a lot. His tests can be difficult. Overall, Dr. Spencer is an amazing professor. I hope I can take another of his classes!","I took this class over summer when everything is smashed into 1 month. Big mistake. I thought it was very difficult I know I take good notes and have good study habits and I still thought the tests were extremely difficult.  He's a nice guy and he speaks very excitedly about history but his tests are tricky.","Good teacher. Its a little hard but he gives you everything thats on the tests. Just study and you will do fine. THe only grades are Three tests and a paper over a book. There is no homework so you just have to do good on the test.","It is too hard, i wish i didn't pick this class!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","it is too hard for me, i can't understand what he is saying. NO attendance requirement, but you gotta listen to him! Take notes! Otherwise you will certainly fail the class. And don't dismiss the paper!","Dr. Spencer is very interesting. I liked his lectures because he told them like a story. He gives you a list of vocab online. take it to class and when he addresses the word, cross it off the list as ur writing notes he goes in order, so u should b fine. His tests ARE difficult so this is y u shld try & come 2 ALL classes! Pay attention 2 detail!","Ok to listen to but test are way to hard.  Has three ID essay questions that are 30% of the test and he rarely gives higher than 7/10 on them. Grades the class paper like he is an English teacher but clearly knows nothing about writing. Don't take if your wanting an A, barely got a B.","Terrible!!! Only 4 grades in class 3 test and 1 paper. The paper is over an extra book you have to buy. Don't expect extra credit. Doesn't take attendance. Lectures whole time and rushes through things to get caught up with other sections. Go to the SI helps by giving you definitions for terms and covering the lechure!","His lectures are interesting but the test are really hard and the study guide he gives are not that helpful.  I never missed a day of the class and studied my notes and I'm probably going to get a C.  There's better History teachers then this guy....take somebody else!","His tests are completely random and when you ask him for help on studying...he doesn't. He puts stuff on the study guide that you have never gone over in class. However, he does explain stuff clearly. But his class is extremely boring...he is so monotonous and tedious","If you go to lecture and can stand to listen to him ramble on, then you might do okay. He is very into politics, so you learn more about that than history. His tests are random...wouldn't reccomend him.","VERY VERY HYPER","I study every week for a month for his tests and a bunch the weekend before his test and I still could get more than a D.  If you go to his office and talk to him he doesn't help that much.  He tells everyone the same thing.  He is interesting to listen to, but even if you go to every single class and the SI you won't do good.  Don't Take!","Great all around teacher and a very funny caffine filled guy but if you are on the border for a grade you are screwed. Even if you are a few points away for the bump. I liked his classes but did not understand his logic at the end of the year when I was 2 points away from the grade that I wanted.

Even if you study for them they're hard.","He tells history like it is a story. He puts in little jokes and really enjoys his job. He is fun and a great teacher.

This is not an easy booster class.","Whittle is the man.  He is super interesting and engaging, and I came out of his class with a new love of astronomy.

Great lecturer and you can tell that he is legitimately interested in the subject!","Very intelligent, helpful, and funny.  His class is engaging and he seems to truly care about his students while maintaining excellent professionalism. His class made me want to minor in Astronomy.","He's a cool and funny professor.  He makes the class interesting, and will take the time to help you whenever you need it.  The class itself is a little tough, but if you study the notes and do the homework, you'll do fine.","I recommend him as a professor, he is very amusing and his class is engaging if you pay attention. He is obviously fascinated by his subject and is very funny. His British accent is so cute. If you wanna take Astro to get your science credit, take this class. Definitely the better professor for the 100 level Astro classes. Tests are fine.","By far my favorite class with no prior inclination to the subject matter.  Prof.Whittle teaches with unbelievable clarity and enthusiasm. He also does frequent in class demonstrations to make a topic such as the universe which is wholly abstract to beginner classes  more approachable.","Whittle is a decent lecturer. He presents the material nicely, and in a clear manner. His tests, however, are absolutely ridiculous. He expects you to memorize random, minute details from lectures and reproduce them on tests. If you truly have an interest in the subject, take the class. Otherwise, look elsewhere if you are filling a requirement.","Excellent! I thoroughly enjoyed his lectures. Brilliant","Oh my god, how anyone could \"enjoy\" his teaching style is beyond me.  Lectures are the most boring two hours i've ever had the misfortune to sit through, and seem totally useless..till you take the tests.  Labs and class are easy enough, but just so boring that I want to cry.","love his teaching style..slowly goes through the material so you understand it.  his tests are a bit harder though, but as long as you thoroughly review the study guide, you will do fine.  there only 5-6 labs and they are all easy/interesting...OVERALL, great class hours (at night) and really nice guy","This man would mame a perfect teacher in Charlie Brown.

Especially \"Culture and the Haulocaust\" if they still offer that.","First off - Marty is a very humorous and sarcastic sun of a gun, but never would he harm a student's feelings or views. He is very engaging and his interest in the material presented before you is not just seen, but felt. He is very knowledgeable and has lots of information to offer - again, with interest and desire in his subject matter!","He is very funny, and makes the topic lighter than it normally would be. Makes it so the material its understood.","Excellent, humorous, down-to-earth professor.  I never bought the book, but he does go over everything thoroughly in class (if you choose to go).  I would highly recommend him.  As previously said, his GA's do all of the grading and they tend to be VERY tight.  I did much better in the more advanced LITR courses.. go figure.","Marty has a lot of fun teaching and you can tell this from going to lecture. His class is easy- even if you don't go to lecture- but if you go to class then you will never have to study. He always has grad students that do all of his dirty work though so your grades on your papers come from them.","Marty is great.  I always looked forward to going to his class.  He is one of a rare breed of professors: funny and cool, but also extremely knowledgeable.  I was laughing and having fun in the class, but learning a lot at the same time.

Make sure you get a great group for team projects.  Keep up with readings and you should be good.","Really difficult tests and TONS of information on only 2 exams. You better work hard on the project!! Doesn't fully cover the ambigous info on the exams.","For the two projects required I stress you look up real life professional busines plans and mirror the format or your grade will suffer. His slides are ineffective in it's application towards a final. The biggest problem is the ambiguity in the grading criteria, he writes his comments in some sloppy cursive which doesn't help.","Grades very hard.

The test questions are extremely vague, making it difficult to do well. The project at the end has no guidance from him and he won't give you clear answers to questions. Overall the worst prof I've had in the business college when it comes to everything.","Nice instructor, hard exams need to read the chapters well and pay attention in the class.","not s good tracher at all talked about his other jobs a lot really had nothing to do with the class.","Nice enough guy. Lots of real-world experience. Folks say he is boring and I couldn't agree more.  Come to class so you get a participation grade, and take detailed notes from the slides.  Study them for the test, and just give the book a read-through. Bring a voice recorder because he covers his material quickly and expects that you caught it all.","Very boring, reads off slides and unclear about grading scale, expects we are business geniuses. Test have no consistency sometimes from all book and the next from just the slides.","He is a nice guy but he is boring and isn't clear about his grading criteria. The presentations for this class is the worst assignment. Take someone else for bus. policy. He gives vague instructions and tends to act like a know it all.","WOW.

Attendance is big, but you'll be asking youself \"it is worth it?\"","His tests are EASY but you have to read the book and pay attention in class which shouldn't be anything new if you are a college student, otherwise you will find the test questions tricky. An A is possible to achieve if you participate in the group activities. I started slacking off second half of semester and got a B in the class.

Go to class and be there for most of the in class assignments and you can easily get a B!","He will bore you to tears, but you have to go to class since participation is 20% of your grade and he randomly takes up in class assignments to guage attendance.

He pushed me to look beyond and challenged me on my suppositions. He was also able to shed illumination on a whole area of Anthropology that I overlooked. He was also available for questions and gave great advice!","Great professor. He makes sure his speeches are interesting and straightforward. He encompasses the exact material that will be on the tests during review days, so passing them is pretty easy. In all likelihood the best professor, I have ever taken. His positive energy is really contagious. He reminds of an older edition of Chris Traeger !","Best professor, I've ever had by far, the best class I've taken in college so far.

The lectures are super interesting and he's very funny and charismatic, so you're captivated the entire time.","I took Anthropology and Film, in a past semester, didn't remember the course number, sorry!

He helps you whenever you need, and is very understanding. His class helped me realize what I want to do with my life.","The only people who could possibly give this fantastic professor a bad rating are the unintelligent ones. Hes extremely clear about what you need to know, as borne witness by the thousands of times you'll hear him say 'so what this means is'. He gives you precisely what you need to know, and clearly loves anthropology.","Birx is one of the most remarkable teachers I've found at Canisius. He is betrothed in the material and the students.

I would not recommend her, at all. ","WORST PROF EVER. This was an ONLINE course with the worst grading scheme imaginable. Two online, group essays. So back and forth and frustrating to try and compose an essay with 5 group members. She is blunt. She is rude and her ideas are always right. She treats her students like they're idiots. Also, won't schedule appointments if  you need help.","An extremely high workload & very critical evaluations of papers. Be prepared for blunt critiques and inconsistent markings.I had my essay paper critiqued from an Honors English major before submission and only received a 50 A very difficult prof to understand writing expectations from one paper to the next. She should be teaching at this level.","I hated every minute of the course and I think I learned nothing.  I'm not sure what I was supposed to learn as there were no lectures.","She does not offer her students anything besides an evaluation. If you happen to struggle in the class she will make an effort to make it even more difficult so that you just drop her class.","Definitely the worst professor I have ever had. The work load of this course was VERY unreasonable and time consuming. She quickly picks favourites and her \"constructive\" criticism is more personal then school related. She lacks interpersonal skills and is one of the rudest people I have EVER interacted with in my life. AVOID HER AT ALL COSTS.","First of all I would like to say that I passed this course. Dr. Schrank is very rude and the work load for this type of course was outrages.  There could be anywhere from 14 to 18 questions per week, with multiple questions withing these questions.  When I did asked her for help, her response was rude and disheartening.","She was helpful and returned papers/marked discussions within 72 hours. She marks fairly and while her feedback leaves something to be desired, she will help if you care enough about your mark to inquire as to how you can improve.","Dr. Schrank is the worst professor I have had during my five years at Memorial. She knows her material quite well and has a wealth of knowledge regarding American Literature, but she is an awful human being. She lacks the interpersonal skills to teach and educate efficiently. I advise my peers to avoid her at all costs.","did this course through distance education. had to do group projects with other members of the class online! it was almost impossible to do!","A distance course with all essays being group work?

As long as you participate and try your best, you should get an A.","I have taken English 1080 through the distance course. She grades unfairly for an introduction course, as well her workload is extremely heavy.

I would never take another course with her","Dr. Schrank is an excellent teacher. She does not deserve the negative comments that are seen here. I think that these people must have misunderstood her. She cares very much about literature. I feel that she is very helpful with her explanations, as well as her critiques. Her personal views are also interesting and insightful.","I did this course by distance and I have to say, she gives feedback quickly and 95% of the time it's very helpful. However, if you are the type of person who takes things personally, you should avoid her. Sometimes her comments are more like personal digs than \"constructive\" criticism. You definitely need thick skin to handle her feedback.","The most engaged professor I have ever had and the most encouraging you will ever meet-if you do your work.","Focuses too much on group work & claims that she never has a problem with it. Thinks very highly of herself and does not like to be contradicted. Rude in her responses. Does not allow for adequate response times in dealing with online issues.

He spends much of the class going off on personal tangents rather than teach.","This professor is uninterested. He sits in the front and \"lectures\" (completely biased) and then goes off on random personal tangents he then gives you test and papers and gives everyone the same grade (a B+).

He just talks about nothing for the entire 2 hour class block and does not give a break at all.  He is the most boring professor I have ever had.","I find every class with Ellis to be two wasted hours of my life that, alas, I will never get back.

Willing to help in any way he can.  And try's to make a boring subject like accounting fun, and interesting.","Papke is a great teacher.

He loves accounting and makes a possibly boring subject not boring at all.","He is a very good teacher and makes the class work very clear. I really enjoyed being in his class and I am going to continue to take his classes. ","His lectures are valuable to build the foundation if you are going further in the accounting field. Hands-on practices are very helpful to understand the concepts. He gives us a test-preview session one week before each exam. There are plenty of opportunities for extra points if you attend each class.","Makes Accounting fun and easy to understand. By far the best teacher I've had at KCC. Attendance isn't mandatory, but every class builds on the previous one and there is an attendance bonus at the end of the semester, so going to class is definitely worth it. If you show up to every class it would be hard to fail.","Took both 100 and 101 in class. He is definetly a different type of guy but super nice. With all the tests he gives you the exact same questions for review just with different #s. Only thing you have to do is a project for running the books for a buss. This is kinda hard but overall easy class and good teacher!!","Mr. Papke gives out a lot of helpful practice sheets.","The in-person class with Papke wasn't bad--he really loves accounting and it shows. He explained clearly and worked through problems on board, etc. The tests are the same as what he goes over in class and you get to use two 3x5 notecards. Really as clear as accounting could be taught. DON'T TAKE THIS ONLINE UNLESS YOU ARE ALREADY AN ACCOUNTANT!","I really enjoyed Papke.  He made accounting interesting for me again and enjoyable.  I would suggest anyone that wants accounting to take him.","Papke makes it fun. He's an extremely good teacher if you make attention.+","Ummm, if you want to be confused and learn everything on your own, he's your guy. I have his class online currently and he is terrible.

Sets up days for class to have discussions/debates which attendance is required. Only other grades are 12-15 page paper and final.","Moderately challenging course. The subject matter and lectures can be daunting at first but Dr. Wan does not require you to master East Asian economics. The exams are not very difficult as long as you dedicate a few hours of studying before hand. He also assigns a 12 page paper but I would recommend the course if you have an interest in the subject","dr.wan is a freaking genius. seriously.","Hard subject...at least for me. But lectures are good and clear.

No slacking in these classes!","At times hard to understand but dosent mind repeating himself. Outlines the entire class and Midterm and Finals are on point with what he gives you to study. Go to class and pay attention and youll be good","Professor Wan isn't too bad. He speaks very quickly, but emails outlines every week for every class.

Her classes aren't very organized but very interesting.  She is very intelligent and you can learn a lot from her...just study everything in your book as well...","I had her for two classes.  Got straight A's until her. Very frustrating.  Skipped two chapters because she spoke abot ONE topic related to one of the chapters in a previous class.  She forgets her lesson plans and barely listens to other students.  Her reviews are pointless. AVOID HER!","I have never met a more disorganized person, which reflected in her class lectures.  Tests are based off the textbook.  Lectures are not helpful at all.  I had to bring in my textbook to class and take my own notes, because she would jump from one topic to the other or stay on on small topic for the entire class period.

My only complaint  is that her tests are difficult and seem to focus more on insignificant details than the core concepts.

The class has 10 modules, all of which are due at the end of the course. Three recorded presentations, web searches and questions about videos and articles make up the course work. Not difficult work but daunting to say the least.","Took 2 classes with him.  Both were fairly easy and interesting.

Great example to all teachers!","An awesome teacher who knows his stuff.

She seems so disinterested and she rushes through everything. Please don't take the course with her if you can avoid it.","Prof. D'Ailly is nice but **very** unorganized during lectures. She speeds through concepts without giving proper examples, explanations etc. Utilize a tutor, textbook, online sources etc. if you are taking it with her.

She also does a bad job at explaining the concepts. And when I do reach out for help, she sometimes ignores my questions, which can be disheartening. I wish she was more organized, gave better examples, and did not ramble.","I feel like Professor D'Ailly is a good person and eager to help her students when they need it. However, her lectures are so unorganized. I still watched all of them, but I had to reference the textbook and online material to make sense of what was going on.

He answers student's questions and responds immediately to e-mails. If you love memorization, then this class is an easy A. There is no assigned paper if you're not taking the honors class - just pure multiple-choice tests. I just wished he had more classes at IRSC.","Dr. Lett was very passionate about anthropology. I took three of his classes. Attendance is a part of your grade. He gives a test on every chapter and he gives study guides that give you the questions. He writes supplements for the classes, which are free PDF files and contain all of the info you need to pass the class. Great professor!","Hated him at first, but somehow ended up liking him. Extensive amount of studying but it is college and not high school after all. Now I know every single capital in the world. Useless knowledge? Maybe. Does it make me smarter than you? You bet.","Great teacher","Dr. Lett is a pretty decent teacher. He has study guides that let you know everything that is going to be on the tests. You must study though, because it's not an easy class. He relies heavily on the book. Tests are all just pure memorization. If you attend all of the classes, an extra 5 points is added to your final grade.","Got a superb grade on every assignment then when it came to the final I studied for WEEKS/HOURS what he requested got a 38% because all the info was the opposite of what he asked so because of that I failed his class and don't you dare ask a question for every question that could possibly cross your mind will be on the syllabus HA YEAH RIGHT","VERY condescending. Professor Lett gives off the attitude that he feels he is better than everyone else and well, if you don't know something he knows you must be stupid. The class isn't hard just be prepared to teach yourself from the textbook. He does not teach. You have a test almost every class and oral review. Hard grader for writing (honors)","He assigns random numbers to each country/state/province and you have to remember the number that goes with it, questions are \"what is the capital of #26?\" If you're good at memorizing, then you'll be fine. But if you actually want to learn, keep looking. I studied my butt off every week for this class, and still didn't get a good grade.","Class much more difficult than I anticipated. You basically have to study everyday. If you're great with memorization, you just may do well. However, you must memorize a massive amount of information, more than just simply identifying location of  countries. Nearly impossible to get a decent grade on weekly discussion postings.","Between the textbook he selects & the study guide he produces & provides for free he gives you everything you need to do well.  He is an excellent lecturer with a sarcastic wit that may come across as arrogant, but I tend to like that in people. Also - he respects your intelligence and doesn't dumb things down; do the work & its an easy A.","Bottom line,  the best teacher at IRSC that I've taken.  Is he easy, NO!  But, you learn a lot as long as you show up, do your work, and study well. I got an A in both the ANT/GEA classes because I chose to apply myself.  Most of my cohorts chose to complain and slack-off, and they deserved their C's and D's. Some ppl are just not college material","Bio anthropology.  Great class but I love the subject.  Lett is an arrogant pain in every way but very knowledgable, very organized, very informative and put together the best online class I have ever taken. Not a good person, not a good man, actually very conceited arrogant and egregiously impertinent, to use his own vernacular. But, great class","I was really looking forward to taking this on-line Geography class for Summer II but decided to drop after having to take a test the first day on the Syllabus that is 45 pages.  He also required a 2nd test on the 3rd day which was on the Preface, 100 questions.  Not student friendly and unwilling to give accomodations.  Extreme amount of work.","Dr. Lett is a great professor.I have had no issues in his class,and he gives you the study guide for the entire course on the first day.If you download the study guide,you will pass.This has been the easiest class I have had this semester!He shows films based on the corresponding unit,and his exams are a replica of the study guide test questions.","I took his online class. he was not very helpful and expects ALOT from his students. I have taken many classes and his is the hardest by FAR and he is the least helpful. The amount of information encompassed in such a short time is almost unreasonable. There is no extra credit. I would advise not to take his classes at any cost!","I anticipated this class to be much more than it was. His style is distasteful, he doesn't offer much \"help\" and easily becomes offended if you do not understand his material.","This man is rude and he ask why you all did not go to a real college. Reply why you teach at this college if its not a real college. IRSC need to fired him he made a statement during classes why you all did not go to a real college; reply was why you teach  here if its not a real college.  If you are black you going to get a C or fail","He is completely unprofessional and incredibly full of himself.

I'm glad I had her for both classes.","She has to look at her notes to make sure she's right when teaching, not sure if she doesn't know what she's talking about or if she's too smart to teach. She's pretty sarcastic and not much help when you ask for it. A lot of homework and the tests are really hard even if you understand the material. Wouldn't recommend","Solid professor who knows what she is teaching. I don't know what people are talking about when they say this class is difficult. If you actually do the homework and study a reasonable amount it is fairly easy. Only complaint is homework was sometimes uploaded like a day before it was due. Take this professor.","I've talked to people in other sections and they don't get as much help as we do (notes, quizzes that resemble the test). Humble, helpful, kind, wants you to do well, grades on curves when needed, extra credit points. She's a real gem and makes you feel known even in a large class.","a lot of work to do, quizzes, homework, papers, SI class and in the test is something totally different specially the 3rd test. she is soooo fast you cannot understand anything from her. the worst class I have ever taken in my life","Professor Breen is my best professor yet. A professor that actually knows what she is talking about. The lectures are super helpful and she gives lecture outlines so note taking is easier. There are a lot of online assignments, as long as you keep up with those and study for the tests, this is a good class.","While accounting is generally a difficult class as long as you pay attention and do you homework you will be fine.

But as long as you kinda know what you're doing, its pretty easy to get an A or a B. Overall he's just a super cool professor. Most of class is spent on completely off topic stuff but that was the best part of the lectures","He was a decent professor. He was the hardest grader I have ever had. If you aren't an English major I don't recommend him.  You can't miss over 3 classes or your grade goes down by a letter grade. We read 5 Shakespeare plays & I don't think I gained much from him. He gives out daily quizzes but you can usually avoid them by getting him off topic.","Good guy. Talks about random unrelated things a little too much. He wont give you a rubric or outline for papers so if you are the kinda person who likes to know exactly what the professor wants don't take him because he will not tell you, he will just give you an F.","Love him. Shakespeare was fun with him. Doesn't know how to start or end class on time and doesn't always stay on topic, but funny and really truly cares about his classes. Will like you if you're liberal, participate, and witty. He loves to see students who care but also likes to joke with students with a sense of humor. Great guy, take his class.","Awesome professor, made Shakespeare a lot more interesting than it would be presented otherwise.  Small quizzes over readings almost every class, so be ready for that.  No exams, instead he does 3 papers throughout the semester. Cool guy, would definitely take again.","A very kind, knowledgeable man. He tends to go off on tangents, but they're usually interesting. This isn't the kind of class you can do the reading for the night before.","Sometimes he can act a bit pretentious, but he's a good professor and pretty likable. The books he chooses for the class are actually really interesting, and he gives short quizzes on the reading almost every day. As long as you actually read the books, you'll do well in the class.","He was the worst prof I've ever had. His lectures consisted of his opinion on politics, religion, and how he thinks life should be lived. If you did not agree with his views, you were wrong. He would humiliate students in front of the whole class. I had an assignment every  night, and dreaded going to class. Would never take again.","Do not take this professor. This class was one of the worst I took at KSU. He never shows up for class on time, and never releases the class on time. He lectures the whole class, about subjects that are completely unrelated. He spews his opinions of religion and politics. There are quizzes every single class, & he is a tough grader on the papers.","One of the best, smartest, most thoughtful teachers I have ever had. If you really want to learn and ask big questions; take Schmitzer. He has high standards, you'll have to workwhich is what you're paying for anyway. Take him. Learn something.","Long, boring lectures. Won't answer questions because they might be quiz questions. Daily quizzes. Attendance matters. Changes due dates and is very unclear. I got a C- on the first paper and was able to finish with an A after a lot of work. You have to read a lot. No final. You'll have to write 2 short and 1 long research paper. Wouldn't recommend","He's a fantastic professor, no doubt about that. He can be somewhat self-righteous and occasionally snobby, but he knows what he's doing. Once you understand what he wants from you, it's pretty easy to provide it for him. Class was simple, and he went off on a lot of tangents. Just be prepared to do a lot of reading.","Professor Schmitzer can be very helpful when you need him to be. He gives plenty of opportunities to excel in the class, as long as you do your part and stay prepared. He can definitely go off on random tangents, and tends to talk about unrelated-yet-weirdly-related subjects at times. Overall I love his Class.","I loved this guy! Made me laugh and taught very well. He goes on tangents a whole lot but it pushes off a quiz. There is a lot of reading but honestly Sparknotes will pass you 100% of the time. He has 3 essays too due throughout the semester but they aren't anything you haven't done.","Yes, he makes you read a lot and yes he does make you take a large amount of quizzes but I promise you that what you learn in this class you will retain forever. He often goes on rants that will last the whole class period, you can easily get him off track if you really want to avoid taking a quiz. He is a tough grader but worth it!","Honestly not my favorite guy. He did not give a lot of explanation in regards to papers and when I would ask for clarification he would go on a philosophical tangent about how I gave up.  He can be funny, if you like sexual humor (which I do not).  While I didn't like him as a prof, he seems like a chill guy. ","I had T.C. for College Writing II as a Freshman this past semester and he is honestly one of the best instructors I've ever had. The course work is by no means stressful and grading wise, he is no harsh. As for papers, you have a minimum of 1200 words which usually is around 5 pages but, the material is interesting and so is he! You won't regret it","Prof. Schmitzer is absolutely amazing! I went into his colloquium class with no interest in the material, and left the class upset that it was ending. By far my favorite college course and my favorite professor. Extremely knowledgeable and interactive, lectures are always interesting. The class completely changed my view on so many things.","Quizzes every day over reading. Reading assignments are not lengthy and papers are a MAX of 3 pages. Tough grader, usually got As in English but got a B in the class. Funny guy who made you work for your grade.","I thought College Writing 2 was going to be so hard. This guy is arguably the best English teacher I have ever had. You take small quizzes over the books you read and there's only a paper per book!(3pages). Thats it. And all you do is openly discuss topics and how it relates to the books.

Hope everything is going well.","Mr. O'Daniel was the best teacher I've had at USI so far.  I had absolutely no desire to take a speech class...now I'm minoring in speech.  He does everything he can to make the class informative.  If you prepare, you'll do great.  And you'll have fun!","Scott is one of the best teachers I have had at USI.  He really cares about the students, and makes class fun.  Everyone should take his class!!","He knows what he is talking about, and despite what people say, he is not full of himself.  Some of you need to learn to listen.  :D Anyway, I give him an A+ for being a great professor.  I feel so much more confident after taking his classes.","He stands in front of class like he is God and everyone is beneath him.  I'm tired of being preached to.","All he likes to do is stroke his ego.","Okay, O'Daniel doesn't give sermons. He makes fun comments along with the imporant stuff. Oh, and whoever said that O'Daniel thinks he is hot, you did not listen. O'Daniel actually slams himself in that category.  Doesn't think he's attractive at all.","This guy only wants to hear himself speak.  If I needed a sermon, I would go to church.  Someone needs to tell him that he's not as hot as he thinks he is.","O'Daniel is a great professor! He helps you so much and he treats you so nicely. Even though purposely he calls me Allison.","Have had several classes with Scott. Very nice/motivated/caring/intelligent prof. Knows/Loves what he is teaching & it shows! Will do anything for those who work. Honesty, integrity, accountability & reading will get you an A or B!","the most amazing thing, he CARES. Though the class isn't too difficult, you can get a lot out of it if you put in a little effort. Mr. O'Daniel is a great guy, and an amazing teacher. Treat him with respect!","Passionate about what he's teaching, and very effective teacher. He enjoys teaching and loves to help you learn. The projects were fun, and the information I learned was day-to-day useful. Everyone should take this class, and Scott!","No Comments","O'Daniel was soooo much fun!

Jeez...I hope this doesn't go to head.","O'Daniel.  What can one say about O'Daniel?  Well..O'Daniel likes Tigger and Donald Duck.  Yes..yes he does.  This is very hot...go disney characters!!

Unfortunately, attendance is mandatory and he multiplies your grade by your attendance percentage to get your final grade which was not clearly stated on the syllabus.  Tests were unpredictable in difficulty.  Homework and attendance grades bring your grade down.","AWESOME! Always enthusiastic and tests were tough but fair","Royce is a nice guy, but mumbles REALLY bad.  His lectures will put you to sleep, but all you have to pay attention to is the demonstrations.  Tests are open note, open book, labs are super-easy.  Willing to help on any homework questions (hw is collected).","Royce is a really nice and funny old man. I like him but he can't teach. Class notes are pointless and are left unexplained. Even though tests are open book/open notes the test questions are so tricky that the book doesn't help. Unless you did really well in physics in h.s. don't take the class!","Class is usually boring; most students don't know what's going on in class.  He's a very nice guy but often unclear on his lectures.  Spend time on homework and you'll do well in the class.

I can honestly say his class was one of my favorites (and I hate math- A LOT).","his class is easy: open book, open notes tests.  he's really funny in lecture and he's a cute old man.  lectures and labs never go the full time.  if you need to take physics, take this class!","This guy doesn't really care about the class at all, but on the flip side, his class is a breeze. Open notes and open book tests and the labs generally don't have to be taken home.","Whoever made those remarks about Royce probably got a bad grade in his class. He gives open book/open note tests. The homework is easy if you just copy what he writes on the board. You'd have to be in a coma to get lower than a B in his class. Great guy.","You might be good at math, you might be good at science, but if you are dependent on being taught the material in class, do not take this course.  Dr. Royce is a nice man but he can't teach and doesn't seem to care if we're learning.

Explains things clearly. Book is boring, must read for exams. Go to class, study, you'll be fine.","This was my favorite class I have ever taken at Towson! He was such a sweet, funny, and intelligent guy. Don't ever skip a class because the textbook is the most confusing thing you will ever read. He gives homework occasionally but it can be done in 20 minutes if you understand it. Tests are tricky, you MUST read the textbook to do well!","Prof Govern was great and the class was interesting. Exams were based off of notes and the book which was a lot to memorize per exam,  but definitely able to pull off an A or B.  Class isn't mandatory but you really need to be there because he puts obscure info. on the exams. I would take him again!","Very good at explaining difficult concepts. Must go to class to get all the material.. the book SUCKS. It makes no sense. Very limited homework. You get credit for a lab class and the lab work is not labor intensive.","1 of the best teachers I have had at Towson!He's funny, insightful,available for help outside of class for those who need it,a fair grader, makes concepts that are usually hard very easy to understand&he relates the class to topics of students interest.He loves what he teaches&it shows every day he steps into class!I strongly recommend to take him!","I had taken stats once before&did not understand A THING.Govern on the other hand,made EVERYTHING so EASY to understand.He related it to topics that interest students&spent a lot of time on each subject so everyone understood.He was fair with grading.Attend class,study for exams&do xtra credit& you'll be fine!I recommend Govern!1 of the best at TU!","Seriously the best teacher I've had at Towson.

AVOID THIS CLASS!!!","ok, i will be honest there are 4 test and 1 paper.If you learn all the definitions for each chapter and also read each chapter you will get a A or B but if you don't at least learn the definition you will be in a world of trouble, not a easy grader either. But a great and very funny teacher. also gives extra credit","Awesome teacher!  Favorite one at Towson!  The paper and project is easy and enjoyable to do!  He breaks everything down and takes time to meet with everyone one on one to talk about your project.  Highly recommended!  I can't wait to take more classes by him!","really nice and jokes around. tests cover material from class and info from the book. there is also a paper you have to do but it's not that bad. Info isn't too hard and tests are multiple choice and essays. I would reccomend him.","He is a really good professor, very interesting & fun. If you take social psych it should be with him. My favorite teacher I have ever had by far.","Funny off-the-wall humor.  You do need to read the text and take notes and study both for the exam.  His lecture outlines the textbook and serves as a study guide base, but you still need to read the text as some questions will be from text and not in notes.  Not an EASY A but certainly doable.  Allows for extra credit to.  Very interesting overall","Excellent teacher.  He makes a not so interesting topic interesting and funny.  He has weird jokes but they help you remember what he's trying to get across to you.  Very helpful and wants you to succeed.

More deadlines than my other two courses combined. I don't recommend this class","Dr. Olmstead was an amazing professor. She genuinely cares for her students if you express an interest and an honest effort in what she is teaching. Her lectures could sometimes be disorganized but overall great teaching methods.","worst person ever","You do not need to go to class - because everything, including the examples, are from the text. The text (she wrote) is tedious and often argues in circles around itself. If you ask a question in class, expect to be referred to the text. All exam questions are from the text. She's also condescending af. I had so much hope for this subject.","I took Olmstead's History of Psyc course. It was a terribly disorganized online course with way too many components (multiple group projects - very difficult with an online course). The questions on the midterm were vague and misleading, the text is VERY student un-friendly! Olmstead basically ignores requests from students. Do not recommend.","Incredible, brilliant professor. She taught me more about research methods and cognitive psychology than the specific courses I took in those subjects. Textbook she wrote for the course is super clear and concise. The course isn't particularly easy, but the test questions are fair and from the text verbatim. Overall, best course ever I've taken.","Not recommended. Her \"textbook\" is awfully written - need a solid background in Comparative Cognition to understand even the simplest concepts. Could have been a fantastic course but the way she teaches it is awful. She doesn't understand how her students could possibly be confused and often gets annoyed with the questions.","She's completely unhelpful and rude when students are trying to ask her questions to clarify concept. The course is very disorganized. The lectures are useless because she CANT TEACH.. She gets very irritated when students have unclear concepts. Not a good prof or even person at times. Course is NOT recommended","worst professor i have ever had. she is VERY unclear and unfair. her tests are ridiculous, and she makes concepts that should be straighforward very perplexing. some of the topics covered in the course i had already learned and understood very well from another course, but relearning it from olmstead made me very confused. DON'T TAKE THIS CLASS!","completely useless prof. she does not explain any concepts clearly, her test questions are extremely ambiguous and she is not helpful. gets annoyed when people don't understand concepts , even when the WHOLE CLASS DOESN'T","There is no textbook for this course other than her assigned readings (which she wrote).  Overall, they are interesting, and I found the lectures fascinating.  She may seem unapproachable at first, but she is actually quite nice.  Labs were great, I learned a lot.","Olmstead has a disorganized lecture style, unclear explanations, and made a potentially interesting course frustrating. Her m/c questions are difficult and often unfair. The assigned reading (which she wrote) were error-filled and unhelpful. The one redeeming quality of this course is the labs, which were fun to do and really helped my mark.","Absolute worst class ever. Lectures were random, notes incomprehensible, EXTREMELY unclear presentation/explanation, impossible tests, labs were time consuming and you got terrible terrible marks with no explanation why even when you ask... The thought of the class 2 years later still makes me angry.  Avoid this prof and class at ALL costs.","Labs are impossible and M/C questions are long, drawn out and have multiple correct answers. She does save you money by not requiring a text, however, judging by the spelling and grammar, her children wrote her word files. I'd advise people not to take this course. Most people seemed angry ALL the time.","Excellent prof","Interesting material.  Challenging test questions (you need to apply concepts), m/c answers sometimes a bit ambiguous/more than one 'right' answer.  Labs are cool but also hard to get great marks in (follow APA!)  Methinks the final marks were bell curved, but still only one person out of 88 got 90s...Neat course, though.","Wasn't interested in helping students at all, and the course notes weren't very clear half the time. She explains things in the most confusing way ever.","Cella is so awesome! She makes the class interactive, and explains concepts well. You have to go to class though... Also, the \"textbook\" is by her, and filled with grammatical errors that may drive you crazy! Quizzes are so easy, midterm is rather hard, final is also easy if you study. It's the lab portion that can really get you...","Awesome class!  By far my favourite class so far at Queen's.

Each exam consists of 40 questions and you are allowed to get up to 6 points of extra credit (raises your grade from B to B+ etc..)

Therefore, a number of lectures were cancelled. He dropped my lowest test score, curved our final grade, and gave ample extra credit.","He's pretty boring.

He drops one of the four tests that decides your grade, but the tests are not complete pushovers. take it.","He is always mumbling and lectures are just too boring. He talks about politics which has nothing to do with psychology. His tests are just too confusing and trickly worded. Pretty hard if you are not a reader.","I hated this class...there is no curve. Theres 4 exams, each 40 questions...he takes the top 3 test scores.  Dont bother showing up to lecture.  Listening to him talk puts me to sleep every single time i go. Just read the book.

You just have to know the entire book by heart. Paper guidelines not clear, but no one got less than a B-. However, I chose not to believe the negative comments on this website about the final. But believe me, it has NOTHING to do with the midterm. Tested on things we had never heard of.","I do not recommend him. The midterm and the assignment are OK however the final is worth 45% and even with a lot of studying, the exam makes you feel as though you forgot to study half of the material. The two long answer questions had not even been discussed in class and were worth 30 marks in total! The final is impossible to do well on.","Good teacher, interesting lectures. However the tests are difficult and he asks you to relate theories to one another (the answers are not obvious, he's tricky).

He is a nice guy and make funny jokes frequently, but his class is extremely DRY and HARD. He is beyond monotone and the exams are extremely difficult. It's too bad because the concept of the class is interesting but the exams ridiculous.

You MUST read the book!! I cannot emphasize this enough. The final is not cumulative, however there are 8 chapters to study for. So make readings notes! Learn the details! Think something's not important? Think again. Overall, he's ok.","He is a really good and interesting teacher.

He will also change the weight of your final if you would like.","I've had Goodaire now for 1000 and 2050, and he was much better in 1000. For 2050, the matrix unit in particular was marked harshly.

The essays were a little difficult but they were pretty interesting to research and write. YAB and the TA were really helpful pointing me in the right direction when researching and providing feedback.","I've never tried so hard in a class before, just to waste an entire year. She wouldn't even mark my final paper and tried to convince me to write a brand new 20 page paper in the last week of school, forcing me to drop my honours to a general history degree. I feel so disappointed by the lack of support and effort she gave me.","okay prof, very helpful with feedback and responds clearly and quickly to emails and questions about assignments. Not difficult to do well in her class but her lectures are hard to sit through. Lectures are all over the place and on a word document so very unorganized and impossible to view. Jumping around of topics makes note taking impossible","I've never had a difficult time in school until now. I'm talking near weekly emotional breakdowns, constant reminders that she doesn't believe I'm at a university level which is quite interesting, being fourth year and this the first time a prof has said this to me. Her assignments are totally unclear, she dominates research topics in a terribleway","Her lectures were scattered. Her notes were on a Microsoft word document with over 30 pages and only get through 15. Assignments were confusing and didn't give much information on what was expected (3-5 sentences of direction) and when asked for further clarification about the assignment she would just repeat exactly what the description said.","A good professor. Has deep knowledge on what shes talking about. Very passionate. Research papers are really hard, you need to put a lot of work in. If you visit her outside of class shes very helpful. Taking notes in her class is pretty difficult but she's interesting. Would recommend for any hardcore history geeks.","LITERALLY an angel prof! Her lectures consist of her just talking so u rlly have 2 be selective and wise with your note-taking. Her assignments arent based on class content so you'll have 2 do some extra reading/ research 2 get a good grade on them. Overall, she's so caring and helpful and the only prof u'll probs have that will remember your name!","The most caring professor you'll probably ever have! She's so accommodating and is more than willing to assist you outside of class. She's quite the historian so her assignment expectations are reasonably high. This isn't a bird course so follow instructions and you'll be fine. She also tells u what to expect for both exams! I highly recommend her!","Bennett is a very caring professor. She is interested in the material and interested in the work you produce for her class. When lecturing she does open a word document with her lecture notes BUT she shares very interesting parts of the history that you can use for the test for an easy A.","Wonderful! Although some of the course material was dry, her lectures made it interesting. Super approachable and makes an effort to really get to know students. You can tell that she wants to see you succeed. Some of her powerpoint slides could be improved by being more straightforward, but overall one of my favourite Carleton professors.","Professor Bennett was the kindest and most respected professor from my first year. She works hard to ease the transition for first year students and is very thoughtful with her feedback. She makes herself available frequently for one-on-one feedback and tries her best to learn everybody's name. A real class act, you want her as your professor.","Shes a VERY helpful prof and gives feedback on everything you do. She tried to learn everyones names in a class of 100+ people and grade things personally if she can. However shes a tough grader, but is more than willing to help you if you go to her office hours. Sometimes she can go on tangents during lectures but they weren't so bad.","Professor Bennett is truly a gem at Carleton. She was by far the most helpful prof I have ever had. She makes the first year transition easier, which is appreciated by all of her students. One of the most respected people at this university.","Lectures are engaging and interesting. There's not much you have to memorize but make sure you're good at writing essays.","Truly the best professor I have had through my first year at university so far.  She really does care for her students to the extent she will send out emails daily just reminding us that she is here if we need help or want to talk. She also does an incredible job of getting to know each student individually which is very hard in a class of 200.","Engaging lectures, interesting assignments (sometimes with vague instruction, but generally if you demonstrate that you engage with the material you'll attain a solid mark). The course was certainly anglo-centric, using mostly British media and sources to draw from for the major assignments.  Friendly and approachable, willing to help!","Professor Bennett has to be one of the nicest people I have met at my time at Carleton. Not only is she very caring for all her students but her lectures are also very interesting and I really enjoyed attending them. She is very helpful at exam time so do not stress about note taking, just listen to what she says and you will end the year happy.","Professor Bennett is one of the best profs I've ever had. Lectures are a little disjointed, but the primary sources for assignments are interesting and marking is fair. She gives lots of helpful feedback on essays and puts a lot of work into helping students succeed in the future.","Professor Bennett REALLY cares for her students.  She was always available, even on weekends, and went out of her way to be there for students.  Top notch professor.","I did so badly on the first assignment, but she let me redo it and gave me the best feedback.

He speaks crystal-clear and at a pace that allows you to get all the necessary notes down. Show up to every class, take good notes, and you'll get an A. I never opened the textbooks. ","Good prof, He is old fashion and doesn't use lecture slides. Exams are more then fair, he supplies you with a short list of possible short essay questions for review and chooses a select few of those exact questions to be on the exams. Create a google docs with everyone in the class and this course is a easy 80!","Ferguson is a typical old fashioned and opinionated professor, and he is definitely a character. I found the class and content interesting, and his personality contributed to that.","Fun guy. One of the only Austrian-tinged econ profs on campus. He will stare you down if you try to ask a question, but there's not much to ask about. Also, don't just repeat what he says back to him in exams or essays, it seems to make him angry. Not that seeing him angry is a bad experience. If you lookup his journal articles, they're pretty fun.","Love this man. Go to class and you will be rewarded. He's not very friendly, but if you do your work you will do well :) .. ps don't be a \"parrot.\"","No lecture slides, no in-class questions, he is the epitome of an old-fashioned Proff. Learned a lot, very refreshing. Go to class and take good notes, he doesn't spoon-feed you. Haters are just too lazy to put in the work that he demands.

Yet, once you finish your degree you realize that he was one of these profs that have done very little in their academic life and they just put up a big act.

Most importantly I have taken with me this useful information: \"Abe Lincoln was the 16th president of the United States.\"","It gonna bomb, like everyone on his tests.","He's straightforward and gets the info into your head. Plenty of examples and time to do the assignments, and they arent that hard either. He's a funny and nice guy.

You can't ask questions because she will make you feel stupid. When I went into the class I did not expect it to be easy by any means, but she makes it harder. I had to teach myself. I even went to her office with questions and she acted like it was a burden. Lectures too fast!","Worst math prof I've had! I took calc at MSU and got a 3.5, but it didn't transfer so I got stuck with her. I understand calc way less now than before, all because her lectures were so confusing and belittled those who asked any question.

Had to put in as many study hours as a 5 credit class with a lab plus more just to pull off a B-.","Dr. Tu expects a lot out of students. She assigns a lot of homework and a lot of quizzes. Her exams are difficult. She goes very quickly at times. This class is hard but it is manageable if you stay on top of your homework and study HARD for the exams.","Honestly, some of these reviews are ridiculous, and made me really scared to take her class. Dr.Tu is the best professor I've ever had! If I ever had questions, she always helped me through them. Assignments were graded and returned within 24hrs. No, the class isn't easy if you don't attend or do the homework. Pay attention and put the effort in.","Great teacher. She is a tough grader but there are plenty of points offered in the class.

It is impossible for me to go from algebra to business calc. and pass, especially with this teacher.  Shame on this university!","It should speak volumes that this is my second time taking Calc II and yet I make less sense of it now than before the semester started.

Take Dr. Bix: Quirky, but thorough and fair.","This has been one of my hardest classes that i have ever taken. As a Calc class in the spring it has flown by, not in a good way. Unless you love math you have to work extremely hard to even catch up. You may ask as many questions in class, and she is helpful, which is def. a plus. If you do not want to take a chance, then take another professor!","I've never been in a class where I worked harder or got a lower grade.

She is one of the best spanish teachers I have ever had. Not only teaches the language, she explains it.","She is so enthusiastic about the subject, but is never very clear on what she wants.  If you ask her a question, her answer will have nothing to do with it.  The tests are literally the homework, and as long as you do decently on the tests you should get a B. I am not sure she actually grades by points, but I got an A so I'll give her a pass.","If you want an easy class for the summer to meet your GED req, then this will be the class for you.

She didn't remember our names after she called on us countless times. Got an A, but had stress all semester bc of this class.","She is supposed to be preparing us for upper division, but does nothing to help up out.  We did things that had nothing to do with Spanish.  Terrible teacher, avoid her if you can.  Being nice doesn't help me learn.","Magaly is a sweetheart, but is not very reliable. Teh class is somewhat of a joke, as she is always late and sometimes does not show up.

This is one of my favorite classes, and I don't even like Spanish!","VERY VERY nice teacher, she tries to accomaodate if you need o leave early or come in late. She is very helpful if you have questions, but she did miss some classes and show up late, as she was having health problems","Not very responsible.  Always late to class or never showed up at all.  Posted grades over a month late.  It is very clear that she has a lot of problems in her life.  She is very nice and will give you and automatic A if you show up to class, wait for her if she's late, and talk with her a little bit but won't learn very much spanish.","She was an easy teacher, but she was very disorganized.

His lectures are terrible, he stutters after every other word and he can't explain something for the life of him.","I may not have enjoyed the course but I still find myself talking about the concepts from it. You can skip his lectures and find his slides online, but the tutorials are mandatory for participation marks. I wouldn't suggest skipping his classes though, because while I found the exams very easy, those who didn't attend lectures found them difficult.","Pretty easy course and pretty interesting.  Go in to class with an open mind, and ask a lot of questions.  Anything that comes across your mind related (or not) to the topic should be addressed, dr myrvold loves to hear those questions.  good bonus marks ;)  (no textbook needed either)","A genuinely nice prof.  Explains concepts very clearly.  An easy class to get a really high mark in with minimal amount of work","Super helpful -- unclear at times, but if you take the time to ask for help/clarification -- he is more than willing to oblige.","a simple course.  Myrvold is an excellent teacher despite these other comments.  He explains concepts very clearly and concisely.","Enjoyable course... simple and interesting.  An excellent elective.","Cannot teach.  Logic course turned out to be the most illogical thing ever.  TA didn't even know what was going on.

But Carmichael can be fun to listen to, so it's a motivation to go to class. Economics was hard, but he made it a bit more bearable.","A pretty good prof. He covers all topics pretty clearly, but sometimes can be a little confusing while explaining certain concepts. Be prepared to spend time on the assignments!","Fantastic course, one of the best I've taken at Queen's. Funny and interesting lecturer; also very helpful. Go to class and take good notes and you'll be fine.","A gentleman at 8:30 and perhaps the funniest professor at Queen's. Still lol'ing at \"Portage-du-Fart.\"","Nice prof, moderately interesting lectures, but Econ is NOT my thing. Don't expect to get an A if you suck at math","Hilarious man. Very clear lectures, always has a pleasant attitude and uses interesting examples to show how the material translates to real life.","I totally agree with previous comments regarding his pleasant demeanour. Always has a smile on his face and puts students at ease. Straightforward lectures and homework assignments. He does, however, have a tendency to go through materials quickly, so be sure to ask for clarification if he loses you.","Excellent Professor. Clear lectures and made the subject bearable. Helpful and positive attitude. He does not use the textbook, so I would not recommend buying it.","No Comment.","Really boring lectures...but if you copy the overhead notes, you should do ok","Seriously, does no one else find him really attractive?","Great prof he tries to make learning the basics as interesting as he can. Although admittedly it can be a bit dry. Always has a pleasant demeanor about him even at 8:30.","Every class is a 55 minute, pauseless , monotone speech - at 8:30 in the morning.","No Comments","No Comments","He presents the concepts and theories very clearly, although the notes on board is a bit messy. He is very smart and quick, always answer questions in a short but definitive manner. And the simple, persistent(almost identical to the old ones) exams made 360 one of the easiest courses at the 300 level.","His lectures are at times very unclear, which is fortunately compensated by the fact that the course has a good flow. He is great at providing short effective answers to questions outside of class.","He's a great prof. I had no interest in econ. until I got into his course.

He's extremely clear and articulate in his lectures, and consistently offers new insight into the texts. The material he chooses is also interesting and varied. He marks very fairly and offers great feedback. Most importantly, he's warm, friendly and approachable with students.","Mike is one of the best profs I've had...if you have the opportunity to take a course with him DO IT! He is completely engaging and keeps the class environment fun and relaxed. It's not hard to do well on assignments with a little effort. He's very accommodating when it comes to assignment extensions. Overall, a great guy and a great prof.","Professor O'Driscoll is great. His lectures directly incorporated and encourages student input. The subject matter was interesting and media varied. Marked well and provided great response and commentary. Beyond the classroom sense he is very approachable, understanding and accommodating. Not pretentious, but inviting! Highly recommended.","O'Driscoll is one of those rare profs that actually makes an effort to get to know students outside of class. His lectures were fantastic fun and as a bonus, he took us all to Dewey's after the last day.","Fantastic prof, definitely one of the best I've ever had. He's one of the smartest men you'll ever meet but he doesn't expect you to be on his level. He encourages participation and NEVER puts anyone down. I don't know if I've ever felt so comfortable in a university classroom.","Dr. O'Driscoll was excellent. I was slightly bored upon first perusal of the texts, but in each lecture he pointed out something that blew my mind and made me see the content in a different way. The group work format opened my mind w/o being tedious or embarrassing. He's approachable, laid back and very inspirational. I'm sad he's on sabbatical.","Amazing prof! Really nice guy, always welcome to class discussion, even if you say something kind of dumb he'll make you feel good about participating. Fair marker, interesting content chosen, probably best prof I've had so far.","The prof was very clear about expectations for writing assignments. Lectures put an interesting spin on the texts (describing context, applying theories) rather than just unpacking them.","He's a nice guy and he's pretty encouraging with his constant \"that's great!\" \"fantastic\" \"good\" comments whether they're not the greatest ideas or not. He keeps you pretty engaged in the class, although I really have no interest in English. Take his class! Easy/fair marker. I was afraid English was going to kill my GPA, but he was nice. Enroll!","Awesome! It's great to just hear him give a lecture, and he tries hard to get the class's input on everything. Incredibly helpful when composing an essay, you can (and SHOULD) go to him at any point in the writing process and he will help big time. Easy marker.","Excellent prof! Phenomenal orator: makes you feel like your listening to something magical. Likes to use theory quite extensively. Very knowledgeable in the areas of Postmodernism/American literature. If your not really into theory, you might want to rethink taking his class. Class discussion was awesome. Leaves very helpful comments on your essay!","Simply the best. Great speaker, engaging lectures. He loves the material and knows it so well, its great to have him share it with you. Good marker, a little hard, you need to put in effort, but its worth it. Books and theory might be hard but its worth it.","A really fun and great professor. He is a fair and easy marker. I really hate English but found myself looking forward to going to his class. Like others  have already said he keeps your interest and is really passionate in what he teaches. I have not seen him get angry at all and he is always smiling.","I loved this class. The material was usually pretty interesting, and I found he marked fairly.","Awesome prof, very fun, approachable and enthusiastic about the subject. Very fair and always in a great mood. Exams are very fair as long as you listen to the class discussions. Workload is quite light although this class has a midterm (whereas most other English 122's do not). Take his class!!!!!","Dr. O'Driscoll is a sometimes-demanding and always engaging prof with a genuine concern for relating the course material to his students. He has an obvious passion for the material and he lights up if you get really into it as well. Fair, clear marker. Great class.","Great prof.  Class was really interesting and easygoing. He kept the mood light.  Workload is also relatively light, exams are not bad as long as you read the texts and paid attention in class.","Dr. O'Driscoll is one of the best profs in the English department. His lectures are utterly engaging. He likes to read passages aloud from the texts he chooses and turns ordinary class into a spoken word concert. He is endlessly enthusiastic and interested in student imput. Take any and all classes he offers!","This prof isn't so much bad as annoying. Adds \"-ality\" to just about every word you can imagine. Be prepared to hear \"the juxtaposition of disparate images\" at least twice a week. Other than the pretentiousness, his class isn't the worst and he seems nice so he gets C+ (maybe B- if you really like modernism).","He is a WONDERFUL professor.
